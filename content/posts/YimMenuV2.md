# Template Hell Base

This base is honestly a joke and a learning opporunity for myself to learn some more stuff about C++20. I went through the basics of what makes a mod menu base and tried to template them to hell and back.

## Structure

- `core/` : Essential general features for the base
- `game/` : Game specific implemented things
- `util/` : Loose functions that aren't game specific
