# Protein design with Foundry

Foundry provides tooling and infrastructure for using and training all classes of models for protein design, including design (RFD3), inverse folding (ProteinMPNN) and protein folding (RF3).

All models within Foundry rely on [AtomWorks](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/atomworks) - a unified framework for manipulating and processing biomolecular structures - for both training and inference. 

## Getting Started
### Quickstart guide
**Installation**
```bash
pip install rc-foundry[all]
```

**Downloading weights** Models can be downloaded to a target folder with:
```
foundry install base-models --checkpoint-dir <path/to/ckpt/dir>
```
where `checkpoint-dir` will be `~/.foundry/checkpoints` by default. Foundry always searches `~/.foundry/checkpoints` plus any colon-separated entries in `$FOUNDRY_CHECKPOINT_DIRS` during inference or subsequent commands to find checkpoints. `base-models` installs the latest RFD3, RF3 and MPNN variants - you can also download all of the models supported (including multiple checkpoints of RF3) with `all`, or by listing the models sequentially (e.g. `foundry install rfd3 rf3 ...`).
To list the registry of available checkpoints:
```
foundry list-available
```
To check what you already have downloaded (searches `~/.foundry/checkpoints` plus `$FOUNDRY_CHECKPOINT_DIRS` if set):
```
foundry list-installed
```

>*See `examples/all.ipynb` for how to run each model and design proteins end-to-end in a notebook.*

### Google Colab
For an interactive Google Colab notebook walking through a basic design pipeline with RFD3, MPNN, and RF3, please see the [IPD Design Pipeline Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZwIMV3n9h0ZOnIXX0GyKUuoiahgifBxh?usp=sharing).

### RFdiffusion3 (RFD3)

[RFdiffusion3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.18.676967v2) is an all-atom generative model capable of designing protein structures under complex constraints.

> *See [models/rfd3/README.md](models/rfd3/README.md) for complete documentation.*

### RosettaFold3 (RF3)

[RF3](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.14.670328) is a structure prediction neural network that narrows the gap between closed-source AF-3 and open-source alternatives.

> *See [models/rf3/README.md](models/rf3/README.md) for complete documentation.*

### ProteinMPNN
[ProteinMPNN](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2187) and [LigandMPNN](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02626-1) are lightweight inverse-folding models which can be use to design diverse sequences for backbones under constrained conditions.

## Development

### Code Organization

**Strict dependency flow:** `foundry` → `atomworks`

- **atomworks**: Structure I/O, preprocessing, featurization
- **foundry**: Model architectures, training, inference endpoints
- **models/\<model\>:** Released models.

#### For Core Developers (Multiple Packages)

Install both `foundry` and models in editable mode for development:

```bash
uv pip install -e '.[all,dev]'
```

This approach allows you to:
- Modify `foundry` shared utilities and see changes immediately
- Work on specific models without installing all models
- Add new models as independent packages in `models/`

> [!NOTE]
> Running tests is not currently supported, test files may be missing.

### Adding New Models

To add a new model:

1. Create `models/<model_name>/` directory with its own `pyproject.toml`
2. Add `foundry` as a dependency
3. Implement model-specific code in `models/<model_name>/src/`
4. Users can install with: `uv pip install -e ./models/<model_name>`

### Pre-commit Formatting

We ship a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that runs `make format` (via `ruff format`) before each commit. Enable it once per clone:

```bash
pip install pre-commit  # if not already installed
pre-commit install
```

After installation the hook automatically formats the repo whenever you `git commit`. Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to apply it manually.
