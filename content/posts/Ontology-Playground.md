A free, open-source web application for learning about ontologies and
**Microsoft Fabric IQ**. Explore pre-built ontologies, design your own in a
visual editor, export as RDF/XML, and share interactive diagrams — all from a
fully static site with zero backend dependencies.

## Features

### Interactive Graph Exploration

Cytoscape.js-powered graph that renders any ontology as an interactive
node-and-edge diagram. Pan, zoom, click nodes to inspect properties, and use
the live search bar to filter entities and relationships.

### Ontology Catalogue

A curated library of official and community-contributed ontologies spanning six
domains (Retail, E-Commerce, Healthcare, Finance, Manufacturing, Education).
Browse by category, search by name or tags, load any ontology with one click,
and view its RDF source. Every ontology has a shareable deep link
(`/#/catalogue/official/cosmic-coffee`).

### Visual Ontology Designer

A full-screen, split-pane editor for creating ontologies from scratch or
editing existing ones. Add entity types with icons, colors, and typed
properties; define relationships with cardinalities; see a live graph preview
that updates as you work. Includes undo/redo (50 levels), real-time validation,
and export to RDF/XML or JSON.

### RDF Import & Export

Full round-trip support for RDF/XML (OWL classes, datatype properties, object
properties with cardinalities). Import `.rdf` / `.owl` files, export in the
exact format Microsoft Fabric IQ expects, and verify fidelity with automated
round-trip tests.

### One-Click Catalogue PR

Sign in with GitHub (device flow) and submit your ontology to the community
catalogue directly from the designer — the app forks the repo, creates a
branch, commits the RDF + metadata, and opens a pull request automatically.

### Embeddable Widget

A self-contained JavaScript file (`ontology-embed.js`) that renders an
interactive ontology viewer on any web page with a single `<script>` tag.
Supports dark/light themes, multiple loading methods (catalogue ID, URL,
inline base64), and click-to-inspect. See the
[Embedding Guide](docs/embed-guide.md) for details.

### Ontology School

A structured learning hub (`/#/learn`) with **9 courses** spanning conceptual
learning paths and hands-on labs:

- **Ontology Fundamentals** — 6 articles covering core concepts (What is an
  Ontology? → RDF/OWL → Fabric IQ → Build Your First → Design Patterns →
  Contributing)
- **7 Domain Learning Paths** — Fourth Coffee, E-Commerce, Finance, Healthcare,
  Manufacturing, University, and HR System. Each path has 4 progressive articles
  that build an ontology step-by-step, with live embedded graphs showing new
  entities at each stage.
- **IQ Lab: Retail Supply Chain** — A 7-step hands-on lab that builds a 15-entity
  ontology from scratch (3 → 15 entities across 6 progressive catalogue entries).

Every article supports **presentation mode** (slides split at `##` headings)
and includes **interactive quizzes** with instant feedback. Ontology embeds
load live graphs from the catalogue with optional diff highlighting.

### Quest System

Five progressive quests that guide users through ontology concepts with
multi-step instructions, hints, progress bars, and achievement badges.

### Natural Language Query Playground

Type natural language questions ("Which customers placed orders?") and see how
they map to ontology entities and relationships — a preview of Fabric IQ's
NL2Ontology capability.

### Command Palette & Keyboard Shortcuts

Press `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` anywhere to open a searchable command palette. Jump
to the Catalogue, Designer, Ontology School, Import/Export, Help, and more without
leaving the keyboard. Press `?` for quick help access. Arrow keys + Enter to
navigate the palette.

### Starter Templates

The designer offers five domain templates (Retail, Healthcare, Finance, IoT,
Education) so new users never face a blank page. Each template creates 3
entities with properties and 2 relationships, ready to customise.

### Interactive Onboarding Tour

First-time visitors get a 5-step guided tour with a spotlight overlay that
highlights the Header, Graph, Quests, Inspector, and Designer in sequence.
Dismissable with a "don't show again" option persisted to `localStorage`.

### Deep Linking & URL Routing

Client-side hash routing with shareable URLs for every page:

| Route | Page |
|-------|------|
| `/#/` | Home (default ontology) |
| `/#/catalogue` | Ontology gallery |
| `/#/catalogue/<source>/<slug>` | Specific ontology (e.g. `/#/catalogue/official/cosmic-coffee`) |
| `/#/designer` | Visual designer |
| `/#/designer/<source>/<slug>` | Designer with catalogue ontology (e.g. `/#/designer/official/cosmic-coffee`) |
| `/#/learn` | Ontology School — course catalogue |
| `/#/learn/<course>` | Course detail — article list |
| `/#/learn/<course>/<article>` | Article view (with presentation mode) |

## Official Ontologies

| Domain | Ontology | Entities | Relationships |
|--------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Retail | Fourth Coffee | 6 | 7 |
| E-Commerce | Online Retail | 5 | 6 |
| Healthcare | Clinical System | 5 | 6 |
| Finance | Banking & Finance | 5 | 6 |
| Manufacturing | Industry 4.0 | 5 | 5 |
| Education | University System | 5 | 6 |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Installation

```bash
cd Ontology-Playground
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The build pipeline compiles the catalogue, compiles learning content markdown,
type-checks, bundles the app, and builds the embed widget. Output is in
`build/`.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test            # single run
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
```

## Deployment

### Azure Static Web Apps (primary)

The repo ships with a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to Azure SWA on every
push to `main`.

1. Create a Static Web App in the Azure Portal
2. Connect to your GitHub repository
3. Copy the deployment token and add it as the GitHub secret
   `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN_GREEN_PLANT_0BB1D2910`
4. Push to `main` — the workflow at
   `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-green-plant-0bb1d2910.yml` handles
   the rest
5. PR preview environments are created automatically for pull requests

### GitHub Pages (for forks)

A separate workflow deploys to GitHub Pages, ideal for forks:

1. Fork this repo
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source** and select **GitHub Actions**
3. Push to `main` — the workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-ghpages.yml`
   builds and deploys to `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

The `VITE_BASE_PATH` env var is set automatically to `/<repo-name>/` during the
GitHub Pages build so asset paths resolve correctly.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VITE_ENABLE_AI_BUILDER` | `false` | Enable the Azure OpenAI ontology builder |
| `VITE_ENABLE_LEGACY_FORMATS` | `false` | Enable JSON/YAML/CSV import/export formats |
| `VITE_BASE_PATH` | `/` | Base path for the app (set automatically for GitHub Pages) |
| `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | *(empty)* | GitHub OAuth App client ID for one-click catalogue PRs ([setup guide](docs/github-oauth-setup.md)) |
| `VITE_GITHUB_OAUTH_BASE` | *(empty)* | External OAuth proxy URL for GitHub Pages deployments (e.g. Cloudflare Worker URL) |
