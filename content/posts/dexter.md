# Dexter 🤖

Dexter is an autonomous financial research agent that thinks, plans, and learns as it works. It performs analysis using task planning, self-reflection, and real-time market data. Think Claude Code, but built specifically for financial research.

## 👋 Overview

Dexter takes complex financial questions and turns them into clear, step-by-step research plans. It runs those tasks using live market data, checks its own work, and refines the results until it has a confident, data-backed answer.  

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather financial data
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Real-Time Financial Data**: Access to income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution

## ✅ Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.com) runtime (v1.0 or higher)
- OpenAI API key (get [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Financial Datasets API key (get [here](https://financialdatasets.ai))
- Exa API key (get [here](https://exa.ai)) - optional, for web search

#### Installing Bun

If you don't have Bun installed, you can install it using curl:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

After installation, restart your terminal and verify Bun is installed:
```bash
bun --version
```

## 💻 How to Install

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/dexter.git
cd dexter
```

2. Install dependencies with Bun:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys (if using cloud providers)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key (optional)
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key (optional)
# XAI_API_KEY=your-xai-api-key (optional)
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key (optional)

# Institutional-grade market data for agents; AAPL, NVDA, MSFT are free
# FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key

# (Optional) If using Ollama locally
# OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434

# Web Search (Exa preferred, Tavily fallback)
# EXASEARCH_API_KEY=your-exa-api-key
# TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
```

## 🚀 How to Run

Run Dexter in interactive mode:
```bash
bun start
```

Or with watch mode for development:
```bash
bun dev
```

## 📊 How to Evaluate

Dexter includes an evaluation suite that tests the agent against a dataset of financial questions. Evals use LangSmith for tracking and an LLM-as-judge approach for scoring correctness.

**Run on all questions:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts
```

**Run on a random sample of data:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts --sample 10
```

The eval runner displays a real-time UI showing progress, current question, and running accuracy statistics. Results are logged to LangSmith for analysis.

## 🐛 How to Debug

Dexter logs all tool calls to a scratchpad file for debugging and history tracking. Each query creates a new JSONL file in `.dexter/scratchpad/`.

**Scratchpad location:**
```
.dexter/scratchpad/
├── 2026-01-30-111400_9a8f10723f79.jsonl
├── 2026-01-30-143022_a1b2c3d4e5f6.jsonl
└── ...
```

Each file contains newline-delimited JSON entries tracking:
- **init**: The original query
- **tool_result**: Each tool call with arguments, raw result, and LLM summary
- **thinking**: Agent reasoning steps

**Example scratchpad entry:**
```json
{"type":"tool_result","timestamp":"2026-01-30T11:14:05.123Z","toolName":"get_income_statements","args":{"ticker":"AAPL","period":"annual","limit":5},"result":{...},"llmSummary":"Retrieved 5 years of Apple annual income statements showing revenue growth from $274B to $394B"}
```

This makes it easy to inspect exactly what data the agent gathered and how it interpreted results.
