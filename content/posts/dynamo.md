# NVIDIA Dynamo

High-throughput, low-latency inference framework designed for serving generative AI and reasoning models in multi-node distributed environments.

## Why Dynamo

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/images/frontpage-gpu-vertical.png" alt="Multi Node Multi-GPU topology" width="600" />
</p>

Large language models exceed single-GPU capacity. Tensor parallelism spreads layers across GPUs but creates coordination challenges. Dynamo closes this orchestration gap.

Dynamo is inference engine agnostic (supports TRT-LLM, vLLM, SGLang) and provides:

- **Disaggregated Prefill & Decode** – Maximizes GPU throughput with latency/throughput trade-offs
- **Dynamic GPU Scheduling** – Optimizes performance based on fluctuating demand
- **LLM-Aware Request Routing** – Eliminates unnecessary KV cache re-computation
- **Accelerated Data Transfer** – Reduces inference response time using NIXL
- **KV Cache Offloading** – Leverages multiple memory hierarchies for higher throughput

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/images/frontpage-architecture.png" alt="Dynamo architecture" width="600" />
</p>

Built in Rust for performance and Python for extensibility, Dynamo is fully open-source with an OSS-first development approach.

- **[Report a Bug](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)** – Found an issue?
- **[Feature Request](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)** – Have an idea?

# Local Quick Start

The following examples require a few system level packages.
Recommended to use Ubuntu 24.04 with a x86_64 CPU. See [docs/reference/support-matrix.md](docs/reference/support-matrix.md)

## 1. Initial Setup

The Dynamo team recommends the `uv` Python package manager, although any way works. Install uv:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install Python Development Headers

Backend engines require Python development headers for JIT compilation. Install them with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

## 2. Select an Engine

We publish Python wheels specialized for each of our supported engines: vllm, sglang, and trtllm. The examples that follow use SGLang; continue reading for other engines.

```
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install pip

# Choose one
uv pip install "ai-dynamo[sglang]"  #replace with [vllm], [trtllm], etc.
```

## 3. Run Dynamo

### Sanity Check (Optional)

Before trying out Dynamo, you can verify your system configuration and dependencies:

```bash
python3 deploy/sanity_check.py
```

This is a quick check for system resources, development tools, LLM frameworks, and Dynamo components.

### Running an LLM API Server

Dynamo provides a simple way to spin up a local set of inference components including:

- **OpenAI Compatible Frontend** – High performance OpenAI compatible http api server written in Rust.
- **Basic and Kv Aware Router** – Route and load balance traffic to a set of workers.
- **Workers** – Set of pre-configured LLM serving engines.

```bash
# Start an OpenAI compatible HTTP server with prompt templating, tokenization, and routing.
# For local dev: --store-kv file avoids etcd (workers and frontend must share a disk)
python3 -m dynamo.frontend --http-port 8000 --store-kv file

# Start the SGLang engine. You can run several of these for the same or different models.
# The frontend will discover them automatically.
python3 -m dynamo.sglang --model-path deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B --store-kv file
```

> **Note:** vLLM workers publish KV cache events by default, which requires NATS. For dependency-free local development with vLLM, add `--kv-events-config '{"enable_kv_cache_events": false}'`. This keeps local prefix caching enabled while disabling event publishing. See [Service Discovery and Messaging](#service-discovery-and-messaging) for details.

#### Send a Request

```bash
curl localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B",
    "messages": [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello, how are you?"
    }
    ],
    "stream":false,
    "max_tokens": 300
  }' | jq
```

Rerun with `curl -N` and change `stream` in the request to `true` to get the responses as soon as the engine issues them.

### What's Next?

- **Scale up**: Deploy on Kubernetes with [Recipes](recipes/)
- **Add features**: Enable [KV-aware routing](docs/router/kv_cache_routing.md), [disaggregated serving](docs/design_docs/disagg_serving.md)
- **Benchmark**: Use [AIPerf](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md) to measure performance
- **Try other engines**: [vLLM](docs/backends/vllm/), [SGLang](docs/backends/sglang/), [TensorRT-LLM](docs/backends/trtllm/)

# Concepts

## Engines

Dynamo is inference engine agnostic. Install the wheel for your chosen engine and run with `python3 -m dynamo.<engine> --help`.

| Engine | Install | Docs | Best For |
|--------|---------|------|----------|
| vLLM | `uv pip install ai-dynamo[vllm]` | [Guide](docs/backends/vllm/) | Broadest feature coverage |
| SGLang | `uv pip install ai-dynamo[sglang]` | [Guide](docs/backends/sglang/) | High-throughput serving |
| TensorRT-LLM | `pip install --pre --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com ai-dynamo[trtllm]` | [Guide](docs/backends/trtllm/) | Maximum performance |

> **Note:** TensorRT-LLM requires `pip` (not `uv`) due to URL-based dependencies. See the [TRT-LLM guide](docs/backends/trtllm/) for container setup and prerequisites.

Use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to specify which GPUs to use. Engine-specific options (context length, multi-GPU, etc.) are documented in each backend guide.

## Service Discovery and Messaging

Dynamo uses TCP for inter-component communication. External services are optional for most deployments:

| Deployment | etcd | NATS | Notes |
|------------|------|------|-------|
| **Kubernetes** | ❌ Not required | ❌ Not required | K8s-native discovery; TCP request plane |
| **Local Development** | ❌ Not required | ❌ Not required | Pass `--store-kv file`; vLLM also needs `--kv-events-config '{"enable_kv_cache_events": false}'` |
| **KV-Aware Routing** | — | ✅ Required | Prefix caching enabled by default requires NATS |

For local development without external dependencies, pass `--store-kv file` (avoids etcd) to both the frontend and workers. vLLM users should also pass `--kv-events-config '{"enable_kv_cache_events": false}'` to disable KV event publishing (avoids NATS) while keeping local prefix caching enabled; SGLang and TRT-LLM don't require this flag.

For distributed non-Kubernetes deployments or KV-aware routing:

- [etcd](https://etcd.io/) can be run directly as `./etcd`.
- [nats](https://nats.io/) needs JetStream enabled: `nats-server -js`.

To quickly setup both: `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d`

# Advanced Topics

## Benchmarking

Dynamo provides comprehensive benchmarking tools:

- **[Benchmarking Guide](docs/benchmarks/benchmarking.md)** – Compare deployment topologies using AIPerf
- **[SLA-Driven Deployments](docs/planner/sla_planner_quickstart.md)** – Optimize deployments to meet SLA requirements

## Frontend OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAI-compatible frontend exposes an OpenAPI 3 spec at `/openapi.json`. To generate without running the server:

```bash
cargo run -p dynamo-llm --bin generate-frontend-openapi
```

This writes to `docs/frontends/openapi.json`.

# Building from Source

For contributors who want to build Dynamo from source rather than installing from PyPI.

## 1. Install Libraries

**Ubuntu:**

```
sudo apt install -y build-essential libhwloc-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libclang-dev protobuf-compiler python3-dev cmake
```

**macOS:**

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
# if brew is not installed on your system, install it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

```
brew install cmake protobuf

## Check that Metal is accessible
xcrun -sdk macosx metal
```

If Metal is accessible, you should see an error like `metal: error: no input files`, which confirms it is installed correctly.

## 2. Install Rust

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 3. Create a Python Virtual Environment

Follow the instructions in [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) guide to install uv if you don't have `uv` installed. Once uv is installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

- Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

- Create a virtual environment

```bash
uv venv dynamo
source dynamo/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install Build Tools

```
uv pip install pip maturin
```

[Maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is the Rust<->Python bindings build tool.

## 5. Build the Rust Bindings

```
cd lib/bindings/python
maturin develop --uv
```

## 6. Install GPU Memory Service

The GPU Memory Service is a Python package with a C++ extension. It requires only Python development headers and a C++ compiler (g++).

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e lib/gpu_memory_service
```

## 7. Install the Wheel

```
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
uv pip install -e .
```

You should now be able to run `python3 -m dynamo.frontend`.

For local development, pass `--store-kv file` to avoid external dependencies (see Service Discovery and Messaging section).

Set the environment variable `DYN_LOG` to adjust the logging level; for example, `export DYN_LOG=debug`. It has the same syntax as `RUST_LOG`.

If you use vscode or cursor, we have a .devcontainer folder built on [Microsofts Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). For instructions see the [ReadMe](.devcontainer/README.md) for more details.
