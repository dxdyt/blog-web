This repository hosts the source code for [https://webvm.io](https://webvm.io), a Linux virtual machine that runs in your browser.

Try out the new Alpine / Xorg / i3 graphical environment: [https://webvm.io/alpine.html](https://webvm.io/alpine.html)

WebVM is a server-less virtual environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. It's designed to be Linux ABI-compatible. It runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.

WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser. CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator. 

# Enable networking

Modern browsers do not provide APIs to directly use TCP or UDP. WebVM provides networking support by integrating with Tailscale, a VPN network that supports WebSockets as a transport layer.

- Open the "Networking" panel from the side-bar
- Click "Connect to Tailscale" from the panel
- Log in to Tailscale (create an account if you don't have one)
- Click "Connect" when prompted by Tailscale
- If you are unfamiliar with Tailscale or would like additional information see [WebVM and Tailscale](/docs/Tailscale.md).

# Fork, deploy, customize

<img src="/assets/fork_deploy_instructions.gif" alt="deploy_instructions_gif" width="90%">

- Fork the repository.
- Enable Github pages in settings.
	- Click on `Settings`.
	- Go to the `Pages` section.
	- Select `Github Actions` as the source.
        - If you are using a custom domain, ensure `Enforce HTTPS` is enabled. 
- Run the workflow.
	- Click on `Actions`.
	- Accept the prompt. This is required only once to enable Actions for your fork.
	- Click on the workflow named `Deploy`.
	- Click `Run workflow` and then once more `Run workflow` in the menu.
- After a few seconds a new `Deploy` workflow will start, click on it to see details.
- After the workflow completes, which takes a few minutes, it will show the URL below the `deploy_to_github_pages` job.

You can now customize `dockerfiles/debian_mini` to suit your needs, or make a new Dockerfile from scratch. Use the `Path to Dockerfile` workflow parameter to select it.

# Run WebVM locally with a custom Debian mini disk image

1. Clone the WebVM Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm.git
cd webvm
```

2. Download the Debian mini Ext2 image

	Run the following command to download the Debian mini Ext2 image:

	```sh
	wget "https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm/releases/download/ext2_image/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2"
	```

	(*You can also build your own disk image by selecting the **"Upload GitHub release"** workflow option*)

3. Update the configuration file

	Edit `config_public_terminal.js` to reference your local disk image:

- Replace: 
	
	`"wss://disks.webvm.io/debian_large_20230522_5044875331.ext2"`
	
	With:
	
	`"/disk-images/debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2"`

	(*Use an absolute or relative URL pointing to the disk image location.*)


- Replace `"cloud"` with the correct disk image type: `"bytes"`
	
4. Build WebVM

	Run the following commands to install dependencies and build WebVM:

	```sh
	npm install
	npm run build
	```

	The output will be placed in the `build` directory.

5. Configure Nginx

- Create a directory for the disk image:

	```sh
	mkdir disk-images
	mv debian_mini_20230519_5022088024.ext2 disk-images/
	```

- Modify your `nginx.conf` file to serve the disk image. Add the following location block:

	```nginx
	location /disk-images/ {
        root .;
        autoindex on;
	}
	```

6. Start Nginx

	Run the following command to start Nginx:

	```sh
	nginx -p . -c nginx.conf
	```

	*Nginx will automatically serve the build directory.*

7. Access WebVM

	Open a browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:8081`.

	Enjoy your local WebVM!

# Example customization: Python3 REPL

The `Deploy` workflow takes into account the `CMD` specified in the Dockerfile. To build a REPL you can simply apply this patch and deploy.

```diff
diff --git a/dockerfiles/debian_mini b/dockerfiles/debian_mini

# How to use Claude AI

To access Claude AI, you need an API key. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Create an account
- Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/login) and sign up with your e-mail. You'll receive a sign in link to the Anthropic Console. 

<img src="/assets/anthropic_signup.png" width="90%">

2. Get your API key
- Once logged in, navigate to **Get API keys**.
- Purchase the amount of credits you need. After completing the purchase, you'll be able to generate the key through the API console.

<img src="/assets/anthropic_api_payment.png" width="90%">

3. Log in with your API key
- Navigate to your WebVM and hover over the robot icon. This will show the Claude AI Integration tab. For added convenience, you can click the pin button in the top right corner to keep the tab in place.
- You'll see a prompt where you can insert your Claude API key.
- Insert your key and press enter.

<img src="/assets/insert_key.png" width="90%">

4. Start using Claude AI
- Once your API key is entered, you can begin interacting with Claude AI by asking questions such as:

 __"Solve the CTF challenge at `/home/user/chall1.bin.` Note that the binary reads from stdin."__

<img src="/assets/webvm_claude_ctf.gif" alt="deploy_instructions_gif" width="90%">

**Important:** Your API key is private and should never be shared. We do not have access to your key, which is not only stored locally in your browser.
