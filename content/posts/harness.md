# Harness — The Team-Architecture Factory for Claude Code

**English** | [한국어](README_KO.md) | [日本語](README_JA.md)

> **Harness is a team-architecture factory for Claude Code.** Say **"build a harness for this project"** (English) or **"하네스 구성해줘"** (한국어) or **"ハーネスを構成して"** (日本語), and the plugin turns your domain description into an agent team and the skills they use — picked from six pre-defined team-architecture patterns.

## Overview

Harness leverages Claude Code's agent team system to decompose complex tasks into coordinated teams of specialized agents. Say "build a harness for this project" and it automatically generates agent definitions (`.claude/agents/`) and skills (`.claude/skills/`) tailored to your domain.

## Category — Where Harness Sits

Harness lives at the **L3 Meta-Factory** layer of the Claude Code ecosystem — the layer that generates other harnesses rather than being one. Inside L3, we pick a specific sub-layer: **Team-Architecture Factory**.

| Layer | What it does | Neighbors we coexist with |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **L3 — Meta-Factory / Team-Architecture Factory** (us) | Domain sentence → agent team + skills, via 6 pre-defined team patterns | — |
| L3 — Meta-Factory / Runtime-Configuration Factory | Deterministic, repeatable runtime configurations | [coleam00/Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) |
| L3 — Meta-Factory / Codex Runtime Port | Same concept, Codex runtime | [SaehwanPark/meta-harness](https://github.com/SaehwanPark/meta-harness) |
| L2 — Cross-Harness Workflow | Standardize skills/rules/hooks across multiple harnesses | [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) |

> Archon generates deterministic runtime configurations. Harness generates team architectures (pipeline, fan-out/fan-in, expert pool, producer-reviewer, supervisor, hierarchical delegation) plus the skills agents use. Different sub-layers of the same L3. Pick Archon for runtime determinism, Harness for team architecture, or combine them.

## Use Cases — Try These Prompts

Copy any prompt below into Claude Code after installing Harness:

**Deep Research**
```
Build a harness for deep research. I need an agent team that can investigate
any topic from multiple angles — web search, academic sources, community
sentiment — then cross-validate findings and produce a comprehensive report.
```

**Website Development**
```
Build a harness for full-stack website development. The team should handle
design, frontend (React/Next.js), backend (API), and QA testing in a
coordinated pipeline from wireframe to deployment.
```

**Webtoon / Comic Production**
```
Build a harness for webtoon episode production. I need agents for story
writing, character design prompts, panel layout planning, and dialogue
editing. They should review each other's work for style consistency.
```

**YouTube Content Planning**
```
Build a harness for YouTube content creation. The team should research
trending topics, write scripts, optimize titles/tags for SEO, and plan
thumbnail concepts — all coordinated by a supervisor agent.
```

**Code Review & Refactoring**
```
Build a harness for comprehensive code review. I want parallel agents
checking architecture, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks,
and code style — then merging all findings into a single report.
```

**Technical Documentation**
```
Build a harness that generates API documentation from this codebase.
Agents should analyze endpoints, write descriptions, generate usage
examples, and review for completeness.
```

**Data Pipeline Design**
```
Build a harness for designing data pipelines. I need agents for schema
design, ETL logic, data validation rules, and monitoring setup that
delegate sub-tasks hierarchically.
```

**Marketing Campaign**
```
Build a harness for marketing campaign creation. The team should research
the target market, write ad copy, design visual concepts, and set up
A/B test plans with iterative quality review.
```

## Coexistence — Harness and Neighbors

Harness is not alone in the Claude Code / agent-framework ecosystem. The following repos live in adjacent layers; each is described in a parallel "X is …, Harness is …" form so you can pick the one that fits your need or combine several.

| Repo | Their position | Relationship to Harness |
|------|----------------|-------------------------|
| [coleam00/Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon) | "harness builder" — deterministic, repeatable runtime configurations | **Same L3, neighbor sub-layer.** Archon is a Runtime-Configuration Factory, Harness is a Team-Architecture Factory. Pick Archon for runtime determinism, Harness for team architecture, or combine them. |
| [SaehwanPark/meta-harness](https://github.com/SaehwanPark/meta-harness) | Codex port of the same concept | **Same L3, different runtime.** Use Harness on Claude Code, meta-harness on Codex. |
| [affaan-m/ECC](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) | "Agent harness performance & workflow layer" (sits on top of existing harnesses) | **Different layer.** ECC is a standardization layer across harnesses; Harness is a factory that generates harnesses. Serial combination possible. |
| [wshobson/agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) | Subagent / skill catalog (182 agents, 149 skills) | **Factory ↔ parts supply.** wshobson is a catalog to shop from; Harness designs the team. Absorb wshobson entries as parts inside a Harness-generated team. |
| [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) | State-graph orchestration, LLM-agnostic | **Different track.** LangGraph is for long-running, state-recoverable orchestration; Harness is for fast Claude-Code-native team design. |

## Built with Harness

### Harness 100

**[revfactory/harness-100](https://github.com/revfactory/harness-100)** — 100 production-ready agent team harnesses across 10 domains, available in both English and Korean (200 packages total). Each harness ships with 4-5 specialist agents, an orchestrator skill, and domain-specific skills — all generated by this plugin. 1,808 markdown files covering content creation, software development, data/AI, business strategy, education, legal, health, and more.

### Research: A/B Testing Harness Effectiveness

**[revfactory/claude-code-harness](https://github.com/revfactory/claude-code-harness)** — A controlled experiment across 15 software engineering tasks measuring the impact of structured pre-configuration on LLM code agent output quality.

| Metric | Without Harness | With Harness | Improvement |
|--------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Average Quality Score | 49.5 | 79.3 | **+60%** |
| Win Rate | — | — | **100%** (15/15) |
| Output Variance | — | — | **-32%** |

Key finding: effectiveness scales with task complexity — the harder the task, the greater the improvement (+23.8 Basic, +29.6 Advanced, +36.2 Expert).

**Exact phrasing to use everywhere:** +60% avg quality (49.5 → 79.3), 15/15 win-rate, −32% variance (n=15, author-measured A/B, third-party replications pending).

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Q1. Isn't "+60%" oversold?</b></summary>

**A.** The +60% figure comes from an **author-measured A/B (n=15, 15 tasks, measured on the sister repo `claude-code-harness`)**. Every citation in this repo pairs the number with the disclosure "n=15, author-measured, third-party replications pending" in the same sentence. For adoption decisions, we recommend running a 2–4 week internal pilot and measuring your own numbers.

**Evidence:**
- Author A/B: [revfactory/claude-code-harness](https://github.com/revfactory/claude-code-harness)
- Paper: *Hwang, M. (2026). Harness: Structured Pre-Configuration for Enhancing LLM Code Agent Output Quality*
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q2. Why "harness factory" and not "harness builder"? Isn't this competing with Archon?</b></summary>

**A.** Archon generates deterministic runtime configurations — it's a **Runtime-Configuration Factory**. Harness generates agent team architectures (team structure, message protocols, review gates) — it's a **Team-Architecture Factory**. They are **neighbor sub-layers of the same L3 Meta-Factory** and serve different needs. Pick Archon for runtime determinism, Harness for team-architecture patterns, or combine them (design architecture with Harness → deploy runtime with Archon).

**Evidence:**
- Archon self-definition: [clawfit docs/reference-levels.md](https://github.com/hongsw/clawfit/blob/main/docs/reference-levels.md)
- Sub-layer declaration: see the **Category — Where Harness Sits** section above
- Archon repo: [github.com/coleam00/Archon](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon)
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q3. Isn't "Claude Code only" too narrow? What about Gemini/Codex?</b></summary>

**A.** Currently the official runtime is Claude Code only. A Codex port of the same concept — [SaehwanPark/meta-harness](https://github.com/SaehwanPark/meta-harness) — is already public, so Codex teams can start there. Harness chose "Claude-Code-native, deep" over "multi-runtime, shallow"; cross-runtime collaboration with sibling repos (meta-harness, harness-init, OpenRig) is on the roadmap.

**Evidence:**
- Codex port: [github.com/SaehwanPark/meta-harness](https://github.com/SaehwanPark/meta-harness)
- Cross-runtime scaffolder: [github.com/Gizele1/harness-init](https://github.com/Gizele1/harness-init)
