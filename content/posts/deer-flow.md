# 🦌 DeerFlow - 2.0

DeerFlow (**D**eep **E**xploration and **E**fficient **R**esearch **Flow**) is an open-source **super agent harness** that orchestrates **sub-agents**, **memory**, and **sandboxes** to do almost anything — powered by **extensible skills**.

> [!NOTE]
> **DeerFlow 2.0 is a ground-up rewrite.** It shares no code with v1. If you're looking for the original Deep Research framework, it's maintained on the [`1.x` branch](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow/tree/main-1.x) — contributions there are still welcome. Active development has moved to 2.0.

## Quick Start

### Configuration

1. **Clone the DeerFlow repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow.git
   cd deer-flow
   ```

2. **Generate local configuration files**

   From the project root directory (`deer-flow/`), run:

   ```bash
   make config
   ```

   This command creates local configuration files based on the provided example templates.

3. **Configure your preferred model(s)**

   Edit `config.yaml` and define at least one model:

   ```yaml
   models:
     - name: gpt-4                       # Internal identifier
       display_name: GPT-4               # Human-readable name
       use: langchain_openai:ChatOpenAI  # LangChain class path
       model: gpt-4                      # Model identifier for API
       api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY          # API key (recommended: use env var)
       max_tokens: 4096                  # Maximum tokens per request
       temperature: 0.7                  # Sampling temperature
   ```

  
4. **Set API keys for your configured model(s)**

   Choose one of the following methods:

- Option A: Edit the `.env` file in the project root (Recommended)


   ```bash
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   # Add other provider keys as needed
   ```

- Option B: Export environment variables in your shell

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

- Option C: Edit `config.yaml` directly (Not recommended for production)

   ```yaml
   models:
     - name: gpt-4
       api_key: your-actual-api-key-here  # Replace placeholder
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started with a consistent environment:

1. **Initialize and start**:
   ```bash
   make docker-init    # Pull sandbox image (Only once or when image updates)
   make docker-start   # Start services (auto-detects sandbox mode from config.yaml)
   ```

   `make docker-start` now starts `provisioner` only when `config.yaml` uses provisioner mode (`sandbox.use: src.community.aio_sandbox:AioSandboxProvider` with `provisioner_url`).

2. **Access**: http://localhost:2026

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed Docker development guide.

#### Option 2: Local Development

If you prefer running services locally:

1. **Check prerequisites**:
   ```bash
   make check  # Verifies Node.js 22+, pnpm, uv, nginx
   ```

2. **(Optional) Pre-pull sandbox image**:
   ```bash
   # Recommended if using Docker/Container-based sandbox
   make setup-sandbox
   ```

3. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

4. **Access**: http://localhost:2026

### Advanced
#### Sandbox Mode

DeerFlow supports multiple sandbox execution modes:
- **Local Execution** (runs sandbox code directly on the host machine)
- **Docker Execution** (runs sandbox code in isolated Docker containers)
- **Docker Execution with Kubernetes** (runs sandbox code in Kubernetes pods via provisioner service)

For Docker development, service startup follows `config.yaml` sandbox mode. In Local/Docker modes, `provisioner` is not started.

See the [Sandbox Configuration Guide](backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#sandbox) to configure your preferred mode.

#### MCP Server

DeerFlow supports configurable MCP servers and skills to extend its capabilities.
See the [MCP Server Guide](backend/docs/MCP_SERVER.md) for detailed instructions.

## From Deep Research to Super Agent Harness

DeerFlow started as a Deep Research framework — and the community ran with it. Since launch, developers have pushed it far beyond research: building data pipelines, generating slide decks, spinning up dashboards, automating content workflows. Things we never anticipated.

That told us something important: DeerFlow wasn't just a research tool. It was a **harness** — a runtime that gives agents the infrastructure to actually get work done.

So we rebuilt it from scratch.

DeerFlow 2.0 is no longer a framework you wire together. It's a super agent harness — batteries included, fully extensible. Built on LangGraph and LangChain, it ships with everything an agent needs out of the box: a filesystem, memory, skills, sandboxed execution, and the ability to plan and spawn sub-agents for complex, multi-step tasks.

Use it as-is. Or tear it apart and make it yours.

## Core Features

### Skills & Tools

Skills are what make DeerFlow do *almost anything*.

A standard Agent Skill is a structured capability module — a Markdown file that defines a workflow, best practices, and references to supporting resources. DeerFlow ships with built-in skills for research, report generation, slide creation, web pages, image and video generation, and more. But the real power is extensibility: add your own skills, replace the built-in ones, or combine them into compound workflows.

Skills are loaded progressively — only when the task needs them, not all at once. This keeps the context window lean and makes DeerFlow work well even with token-sensitive models.

Tools follow the same philosophy. DeerFlow comes with a core toolset — web search, web fetch, file operations, bash execution — and supports custom tools via MCP servers and Python functions. Swap anything. Add anything.

```
# Paths inside the sandbox container
/mnt/skills/public
├── research/SKILL.md
├── report-generation/SKILL.md
├── slide-creation/SKILL.md
├── web-page/SKILL.md
└── image-generation/SKILL.md

/mnt/skills/custom
└── your-custom-skill/SKILL.md      ← yours
```

### Sub-Agents

Complex tasks rarely fit in a single pass. DeerFlow decomposes them.

The lead agent can spawn sub-agents on the fly — each with its own scoped context, tools, and termination conditions. Sub-agents run in parallel when possible, report back structured results, and the lead agent synthesizes everything into a coherent output.

This is how DeerFlow handles tasks that take minutes to hours: a research task might fan out into a dozen sub-agents, each exploring a different angle, then converge into a single report — or a website — or a slide deck with generated visuals. One harness, many hands.

### Sandbox & File System

DeerFlow doesn't just *talk* about doing things. It has its own computer.

Each task runs inside an isolated Docker container with a full filesystem — skills, workspace, uploads, outputs. The agent reads, writes, and edits files. It executes bash commands and codes. It views images. All sandboxed, all auditable, zero contamination between sessions.

This is the difference between a chatbot with tool access and an agent with an actual execution environment.

```
# Paths inside the sandbox container
/mnt/user-data/
├── uploads/          ← your files
├── workspace/        ← agents' working directory
└── outputs/          ← final deliverables
```

### Context Engineering

**Isolated Sub-Agent Context**: Each sub-agent runs in its own isolated context. This means that the sub-agent will not be able to see the context of the main agent or other sub-agents. This is important to ensure that the sub-agent is able to focus on the task at hand and not be distracted by the context of the main agent or other sub-agents.

**Summarization**: Within a session, DeerFlow manages context aggressively — summarizing completed sub-tasks, offloading intermediate results to the filesystem, compressing what's no longer immediately relevant. This lets it stay sharp across long, multi-step tasks without blowing the context window.

### Long-Term Memory

Most agents forget everything the moment a conversation ends. DeerFlow remembers.

Across sessions, DeerFlow builds a persistent memory of your profile, preferences, and accumulated knowledge. The more you use it, the better it knows you — your writing style, your technical stack, your recurring workflows. Memory is stored locally and stays under your control.

## Recommended Models

DeerFlow is model-agnostic — it works with any LLM that implements the OpenAI-compatible API. That said, it performs best with models that support:

- **Long context windows** (100k+ tokens) for deep research and multi-step tasks
- **Reasoning capabilities** for adaptive planning and complex decomposition
- **Multimodal inputs** for image understanding and video comprehension
- **Strong tool-use** for reliable function calling and structured outputs
