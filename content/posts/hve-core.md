Hypervelocity Engineering (HVE) Core is an enterprise-ready prompt engineering framework for GitHub Copilot. Constraint-based AI workflows, validated artifacts, and structured methodologies that scale from solo developers to large teams.

> [!TIP]
> Install via VS Code extension or Copilot CLI plugin (~30 seconds). See the [Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/install.md).

## Overview

HVE Core provides specialized agents, reusable prompts, instruction sets, and skills with JSON schema validation. The framework separates AI concerns into distinct artifact types with clear boundaries, preventing runaway behavior through constraint-based design.

The RPI (Research → Plan → Implement) methodology structures complex engineering tasks into phases where AI knows what it cannot do, changing optimization targets from "plausible code" to "verified truth."

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

Install the VS Code extension from the Marketplace:

[![Install HVE Core](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install_HVE_Core-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ise-hve-essentials.hve-core)

Need a different installation method? See the [Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/install.md) for CLI plugins, submodules, multi-root workspaces, and more.

### 2. Verify

Open GitHub Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`) and check that HVE Core agents appear in the agent picker. Look for **task-researcher**, **task-planner**, and **rpi-agent**.

### 3. Try It

Select the **memory** agent and type:

> Remember that I'm exploring HVE Core for the first time.

The agent creates a memory file in your workspace. You now have a working HVE Core installation that responds to natural language.

## Prompt Engineering Framework

HVE Core provides a structured approach to prompt engineering with four artifact types, each serving a distinct purpose:

| Artifact         | Purpose                                               | Activation                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Instructions** | Passive reference guidance applied by file pattern    | Automatic via `applyTo` glob |
| **Prompts**      | Task-specific procedures with input variables         | Manual via `/` command       |
| **Agents**       | Specialized personas with tool access and constraints | Manual via agent picker      |
| **Skills**       | Executable utilities with cross-platform scripts      | Read by Copilot on demand    |

### Key Capabilities

* Protocol patterns support step-based (sequential) and phase-based (conversational) workflow formats
* Input variables use `${input:variableName}` syntax with defaults and VS Code integration
* Subagent delegation provides a first-class pattern for tool-heavy work via `runSubagent`
* Maturity lifecycle follows a four-stage model (`experimental` → `preview` → `stable` → `deprecated`)

Use the `prompt-builder` agent to create new artifacts following these patterns.

## Enterprise Validation Pipeline

All AI artifacts are validated through a CI/CD pipeline with JSON schema enforcement:

```text
*.instructions.md → instruction-frontmatter.schema.json
*.prompt.md       → prompt-frontmatter.schema.json
*.agent.md        → agent-frontmatter.schema.json
SKILL.md          → skill-frontmatter.schema.json
```

The validation system provides:

* Typed frontmatter validation provides structured error reporting.
* Pattern-based schema mapping enables automatic file type detection.
* Maturity enforcement ensures artifacts declare stability level.
* Link and language checks validate cross-references.

Run `npm run lint:frontmatter` locally before committing changes.
