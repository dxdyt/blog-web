### Frontend

Next.js/React application providing a responsive UI with chat interface, dashboard, etc.

### Agent Docker

Isolated execution environment for every agent - with browser automation, code interpreter, file system access, tool integration, and security features.

### Supabase Database

Handles data persistence with authentication, user management, conversation history, file storage, agent state, analytics, and real-time subscriptions.
