_Made with ‚ô•Ô∏è by <a href="https://resemble.ai" target="_blank"><img width="100" alt="resemble-logo-horizontal" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35cf756b-3506-4943-9c72-c05ddfa4e525" /></a>

We're excited to introduce Chatterbox, [Resemble AI's](https://resemble.ai) first production-grade open source TTS model. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.

Whether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life. It's also the first open source TTS model to support **emotion exaggeration control**, a powerful feature that makes your voices stand out. Try it now on our [Hugging Face Gradio app.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ResembleAI/Chatterbox)

If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (<a href="https://resemble.ai">link</a>). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms‚Äîideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.

# Key Details
- SoTA zeroshot TTS
- 0.5B Llama backbone
- Unique exaggeration/intensity control
- Ultra-stable with alignment-informed inference
- Trained on 0.5M hours of cleaned data
- Watermarked outputs
- Easy voice conversion script
- [Outperforms ElevenLabs](https://podonos.com/resembleai/chatterbox)

# Tips
- **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
  - The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts.
  - If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.

- **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
  - Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
  - Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.


# Installation
```shell
pip install chatterbox-tts
```

Alternatively, you can install from source:
```shell
# conda create -yn chatterbox python=3.11
# conda activate chatterbox

git clone https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox.git
cd chatterbox
pip install -e .
```
We developed and tested Chatterbox on Python 3.11 on Debain 11 OS; the versions of the dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistency. You can modify the code or dependencies in this installation mode.


# Usage
```python
import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS

model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")

text = "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav = model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-1.wav", wav, model.sr)

# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"
wav = model.generate(text, audio_prompt_path=AUDIO_PROMPT_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)
```
See `example_tts.py` and `example_vc.py` for more examples.

# Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes [Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker](https://github.com/resemble-ai/perth) - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.


## Watermark extraction

You can look for the watermark using the following script.

```python
import perth
import librosa

AUDIO_PATH = "YOUR_FILE.wav"

# Load the watermarked audio
watermarked_audio, sr = librosa.load(AUDIO_PATH, sr=None)

# Initialize watermarker (same as used for embedding)
watermarker = perth.PerthImplicitWatermarker()

# Extract watermark
watermark = watermarker.get_watermark(watermarked_audio, sample_rate=sr)
print(f"Extracted watermark: {watermark}")
# Output: 0.0 (no watermark) or 1.0 (watermarked)
```
