AI coding tools can end up re-reading large parts of your codebase on review tasks. `code-review-graph` fixes that. It builds a structural map of your code with [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), tracks changes incrementally, and gives your AI assistant precise context via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) so it reads only what matters.

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram1_before_vs_after.png" alt="The Token Problem: 38x to 528x token reduction across 6 real repositories" width="85%" />
</p>

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install code-review-graph                     # or: pipx install code-review-graph
code-review-graph install          # auto-detects and configures all supported platforms
code-review-graph build            # parse your codebase
```

One command sets up everything. `install` detects which AI coding tools you have, writes the correct MCP configuration for each one, installs platform-native hooks/skills where supported, and injects graph-aware instructions into your platform rules. It auto-detects whether you installed via `uvx` or `pip`/`pipx` and generates the right config. Restart your editor/tool after installing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram8_supported_platforms.png" alt="One Install, Every Platform: auto-detects Codex, Claude Code, CodeBuddy Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Continue, OpenCode, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Qwen, Qoder, Kiro, and GitHub Copilot" width="85%" />
</p>

To target a specific platform:

```bash
code-review-graph install --platform codex       # configure only Codex
code-review-graph install --platform cursor      # configure only Cursor
code-review-graph install --platform claude-code  # configure only Claude Code
code-review-graph install --platform gemini-cli   # configure only Gemini CLI
code-review-graph install --platform kiro         # configure only Kiro
code-review-graph install --platform copilot      # configure only GitHub Copilot (VS Code)
code-review-graph install --platform copilot-cli  # configure only GitHub Copilot CLI
code-review-graph install --platform codebuddy    # configure only CodeBuddy Code
```

Requires Python 3.10+. For the best experience, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (the MCP config will use `uvx` if available, otherwise falls back to the `code-review-graph` command directly).

To remove CRG from a Git or SVN project, use the symmetric uninstall command
from anywhere inside its working tree. The target is normalized to the working
tree root, and non-repository directories are refused. It removes only
CRG-owned files and entries; unrelated MCP servers, hooks, skills, and JSONC
comments remain untouched. Shared configuration changes use atomic replacement
so a failed write leaves the original file intact.

```bash
code-review-graph uninstall --dry-run    # preview every action; write nothing
code-review-graph uninstall              # preview, ask for confirmation, then apply
code-review-graph uninstall --yes        # apply without prompting
code-review-graph uninstall --all-repos  # also clean every registered repository
code-review-graph uninstall --keep-data  # remove integrations but keep graph databases
code-review-graph uninstall --keep-user-configs --repo .  # clean this project only
```

Then open your project and ask your AI assistant:

```
Build the code review graph for this project
```

The initial build takes ~10 seconds for a 500-file project. After that, watch mode and supported hooks can keep the graph updated automatically.


## How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram7_mcp_integration_flow.png" alt="How your AI assistant uses the graph: User asks for review, AI checks MCP tools, graph returns blast radius and risk scores, AI reads only what matters" width="80%" />
</p>

Your repository is parsed into an AST with Tree-sitter, stored as a graph of nodes (functions, classes, imports) and edges (calls, inheritance, test coverage), then queried at review time to compute the minimal set of files your AI assistant needs to read.

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram2_architecture_pipeline.png" alt="Architecture pipeline: Repository to Tree-sitter Parser to SQLite Graph to Blast Radius to Minimal Review Set" width="100%" />
</p>

### Blast-radius analysis

When a file changes, the graph traces every caller, dependent, and test that could be affected. This is the "blast radius" of the change. Your AI reads only these files instead of scanning the whole project.

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram3_blast_radius.png" alt="Blast radius visualization showing how a change to login() propagates to callers, dependents, and tests" width="70%" />
</p>

### Incremental updates in < 2 seconds

When hooks or watch mode are enabled, file saves and supported commit hooks trigger incremental updates. The graph diffs changed files, finds their dependents via SHA-256 hash checks, and re-parses only what changed. A 2,900-file project re-indexes in under 2 seconds.

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram4_incremental_update.png" alt="Incremental update flow: supported hook or watch update triggers diff, finds dependents, re-parses only 5 files while 2,910 are skipped" width="90%" />
</p>

### The monorepo problem, solved

Large monorepos are where token waste is most painful. The graph cuts through the noise — 27,700+ files excluded from review context, only ~15 files actually read.

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram6_monorepo_funnel.png" alt="code-review-graph repo: 208,821 source tokens funnel down to ~2,495 token graph responses — 93x fewer tokens per question" width="80%" />
</p>

### Broad language coverage + Jupyter notebooks

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram9_language_coverage.png" alt="Language coverage organized by category: Web, Backend, Systems, Mobile, Scripting, Config, plus Jupyter and Databricks notebook support" width="90%" />
</p>

Parser support covers functions, classes, imports, call sites, inheritance, and test detection across the current parser surface, using Tree-sitter where available and targeted fallbacks where needed. Current support includes Python, JavaScript/TypeScript/TSX, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, C#, VB.NET, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift, PHP, Scala, Solidity, Dart, R, Perl, Lua/Luau, Objective-C, shell scripts, Elixir, Zig, PowerShell, Julia, ReScript, GDScript, Nix, Verilog/SystemVerilog, SQL, Terraform/OpenTofu structure (`.tf`; generic `.hcl` files are recognized as file nodes), Ansible playbooks/roles/tasks, Vue/Svelte SFCs, Astro files parsed through the TypeScript parser, Jupyter/Databricks notebooks (`.ipynb`), and Perl XS files (`.xs`). Generic YAML is not treated as source code.

PHP projects additionally get repository-bounded Composer PSR-4 resolution,
Blade template references, and Laravel Route/Eloquent semantic edges when the
source includes explicit framework imports, model inheritance, and receiver
evidence.

### Add your own language (no fork needed)

If your repo uses a language the parser does not cover yet, drop a `languages.toml` into `.code-review-graph/` mapping file extensions to any grammar bundled in `tree_sitter_language_pack`, plus the tree-sitter node types for functions, classes, imports, and calls:

```toml
[languages.erlang]
extensions = [".erl"]
grammar = "erlang"
function_node_types = ["function_clause"]
class_node_types = ["record_decl"]
import_node_types = ["import_attribute"]
call_node_types = ["call"]
```

The generic tree-sitter walker handles extraction from there — no code changes, and built-in languages can never be overridden. See [docs/CUSTOM_LANGUAGES.md](docs/CUSTOM_LANGUAGES.md) for the schema reference, validation rules, and a worked end-to-end example.

### Risk-scored PR reviews in CI (GitHub Action)

The same analysis runs as a composite GitHub Action — and it stays local-first: the knowledge graph is built and queried entirely on your CI runner, with no source code sent to any external service. On each pull request the action posts a single sticky comment with risk-scored functions, affected execution flows, and test gaps, updated in place on every push. An optional `fail-on-risk` input turns the review into a merge gate.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/code-review-graph.yml
on:
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: tirth8205/code-review-graph@v2.3.6
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

See [docs/GITHUB_ACTION.md](docs/GITHUB_ACTION.md) for inputs, risk levels, and caching details, or the dogfood workflow this repo runs on itself in [`.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-review.yml).

## Benchmarks

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/diagram5_benchmark_board.png" alt="Benchmarks across 6 real repositories: ~82x median per-question token reduction (528x max), 0.71 average impact F1 against graph-derived ground truth" width="85%" />
</p>

**Headline number: the median per-question token reduction across the 6 repos is ~82x** (whole-corpus baseline vs graph query). The frequently quoted **528x is the maximum** — a single best-case repo (fastapi) — not the typical result.

All numbers come from the automated evaluation runner against 6 real open-source repositories (13 commits total). Every config pins an upstream SHA, the Leiden community detector runs with a fixed seed, and embeddings are deterministic on CPU — so two runs on different machines produce identical numbers. The full reproduction recipe with expected outputs is in [`docs/REPRODUCING.md`](docs/REPRODUCING.md). A weekly report-only run on the two smallest configs lives in [`.github/workflows/eval.yml`](.github/workflows/eval.yml).

<details>
<summary><strong>Token efficiency: ~82x median per-question reduction (range 38x – 528x; whole-corpus vs graph query)</strong></summary>
<br>

For a typical agent question (`"how does authentication work"`, `"what is the main entry point"`, etc.), the graph returns ~2,000–3,500 tokens of targeted search hits + neighbor edges instead of forcing the agent to read every source file. The table below averages over the 5 sample questions defined in `code_review_graph/token_benchmark.py`.

| Repo | Snapshot SHA | naive_corpus_tokens | avg graph_tokens | Reduction |
|------|---|-----------------:|----------------:|----------:|
| fastapi | `0227991a` | 951,071 | 2,169 | **528.4x** |
| code-review-graph | `84bde354` | 208,821 | 2,495 | **93.0x** |
| gin | `5c00df8a` | 166,868 | 1,990 | **91.8x** |
| flask | `a29f88ce` | 125,022 | 1,986 | **71.4x** |
| express | `b4ab7d65` | 135,955 | 3,465 | **40.6x** |
| httpx | `b55d4635` | 89,492 | 2,438 | **38.0x** |

Median per-question reduction across the 6 repos: **~82x**. The range is 38x – 528x, where **528x is the best case** (fastapi, the largest corpus), not the headline.

The whole-corpus baseline above is an upper bound no real agent pays: a competent agent greps for identifiers and reads only the best-matching files. The `agent_baseline` eval benchmark measures that realistic baseline — a pure-python grep over the corpus, top-3 files by match count, token-counted and compared to the graph query cost (`evaluate/results/<repo>_agent_baseline_*.csv`).

The formal `eval/benchmarks/token_efficiency.py` benchmark measures a different scenario — full `get_review_context()` JSON versus just the changed-file content of a commit — and reports ratios below 1 for small commits, because the review-context response carries impact-radius edges plus source snippets that exceed a tiny single-file diff. That is not a bug; the two benchmarks answer different questions. See [`docs/REPRODUCING.md`](docs/REPRODUCING.md) for the full methodology.

Since v2.3.4, review and impact tools attach a compact `context_savings` estimate so MCP clients can see the approximate context saved per call. In v2.3.5 the CLI surfaces this as the boxed `Token Savings` panel shown above (see "Token Savings panel" in the Usage section) and adds `--verify` to cross-check against OpenAI's `cl100k_base` tokenizer. Calibration data in [`docs/REPRODUCING.md`](docs/REPRODUCING.md) shows the estimate is within ~1% of real GPT-4 tokens in aggregate across 222 sample files.

<details>
<summary><strong>Impact accuracy: 0.71 average F1 against graph-derived ground truth (recall 1.0 is a circular upper bound, not "100% recall")</strong></summary>
<br>

Blast-radius analysis recovers every file in the ground truth on all 13 evaluation commits — **but read that as an upper bound, not as "100% recall"**: in this mode the ground truth (changed files + files with call/import edges into them) is derived from the same graph the predictor traverses, so it is circular by construction. The over-prediction visible in the precision column is a deliberate trade-off: better to flag too many files than miss a broken dependency.

| Repo | Commits | Avg F1 | Avg Precision | Recall (graph-derived upper bound) |
|------|--------:|-------:|--------------:|-------:|
| httpx | 2 | 0.864 | 0.786 | 1.0 |
| fastapi | 2 | 0.834 | 0.750 | 1.0 |
| code-review-graph | 2 | 0.734 | 0.584 | 1.0 |
| express | 2 | 0.667 | 0.500 | 1.0 |
| flask | 2 | 0.628 | 0.481 | 1.0 |
| gin | 3 | 0.609 | 0.439 | 1.0 |
| **Average** | **13** | **0.714** | **0.578** | **1.000** |

The benchmark also runs an honest **co-change mode**: the predictor is seeded with a single changed file and graded against the *other* files the author actually touched in the same commit — independent-ish evidence from git history, not from the graph. Both modes appear side by side in the result CSVs (`ground_truth_mode` column). Co-change numbers will be added to the canonical stats once captured by the eval runner; we do not quote them before measuring.

### Limitations and known weaknesses

- **Impact "recall 1.0" is graph-derived and circular:** the historical ground truth comes from the same graph edges the predictor walks, so it is an upper bound by construction. The honest co-change mode (grade against files actually co-changed in the same commit) is measured alongside it; expect those numbers to be substantially lower.
- **Small single-file changes:** Graph context can exceed naive file reads for trivial edits (see express results above). The overhead is the structural metadata that enables multi-file analysis.
- **Search quality (MRR 0.35):** Keyword search finds the right result in the top-4 for most queries, but ranking needs improvement. Express queries return 0 hits due to module-pattern naming.
- **Flow detection (33% recall):** Framework and conventional entry patterns are strongest for Python and PHP/Laravel. JavaScript and Go flow detection needs work.
- **Precision vs recall trade-off:** Impact analysis is deliberately conservative. It flags files that *might* be affected, which means some false positives in large dependency graphs.

default. They can contain absolute paths and code-structure metadata, so inspect
and sanitize an export before publishing it outside your machine.

<details>
<summary><strong>Token Savings panel: <code>detect-changes --brief</code> vs <code>update --brief</code></strong></summary>
<br>

Both commands print the same compact panel showing how many tokens the
graph saved you compared to handing the changed files to an agent raw.
They differ in **one** thing: whether the graph gets refreshed first.

```text
┌─────────────────────── Token Savings ────────────────────────┐
│ Full context would be:     12,921 tokens                     │
│ Graph context used:           762 tokens                     │
│ Saved:                     12,159 tokens (~94%)              │
│ Breakdown: Functions 244 · Tests 191 · Risk 244 · Other 83   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `detect-changes --brief` | **Read-only.** Looks at your current changes, queries the **existing** graph, prints the panel. ~1 sec. | Most of the time — the hooks (or `crg-daemon`) keep the graph fresh in the background, so this is enough. |
| `update --brief` | **Re-parses your changed files into the graph first**, then prints the same panel. ~5 sec. | After a rebase, a large change set, or any time you suspect the graph is stale. |

Both end with the **same panel** because both call the same `analyze_changes()` step at the end. The difference is whether the graph itself got refreshed before that analysis ran.

Add `--verify` to either command to cross-check the displayed numbers against OpenAI's `cl100k_base` tokenizer (the GPT-4 family). Requires `pip install tiktoken`. The estimate stays within ~1% of real tokens on a typical change set — see [`docs/REPRODUCING.md`](docs/REPRODUCING.md) for the calibration data.

The same `context_savings` metadata is also attached automatically to the JSON responses of `get_impact_radius`, `get_review_context`, `detect_changes`, and `get_architecture_overview` MCP tools, so AI agents can surface the savings to humans in chat without any extra prompting.

<summary><strong>Multi-repo daemon</strong></summary>
<br>

If your editor doesn't support hooks (e.g. Cursor, OpenCode), or you just want your
graph to stay fresh in the background without any editor integration, the daemon is
for you. It watches your repos for file changes and automatically rebuilds the graph
— no manual `build` or `update` commands needed.

The daemon is included with `code-review-graph` — no separate install required.

**Quick setup:**

```bash
# 1. Register the repos you want to watch
crg-daemon add ~/project-a --alias proj-a
crg-daemon add ~/project-b

# 2. Start the daemon (runs in the background)
crg-daemon start

# 3. That's it — graphs stay up to date automatically
crg-daemon status                 # check daemon and per-repo watcher status
crg-daemon logs --repo proj-a -f  # tail logs for a specific repo
crg-daemon stop                   # stop daemon and all watcher processes
```

Also available as `code-review-graph daemon start|stop|status|...`.

Under the hood, `crg-daemon add` writes to a TOML config file at
`~/.code-review-graph/watch.toml`. You can also edit this file directly:

```toml
[[repos]]
path = "/home/user/project-a"
alias = "proj-a"

[[repos]]
path = "/home/user/project-b"
alias = "project-b"
```

The daemon monitors this config file for changes and automatically starts/stops
watcher processes as repos are added or removed. Health checks every 30 seconds
restart dead watchers. No external dependencies required.

See [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md#standalone-daemon-cli-crg-daemon) for the
full config reference and all available options.

<summary><strong>Configuration</strong></summary>
<br>

To exclude paths from indexing, create a `.code-review-graphignore` file in your repository root:

```
generated/**
*.generated.ts
vendor/**
node_modules/**
```

Note: in git repos, only tracked files are indexed (`git ls-files`), so gitignored files are skipped automatically. Use `.code-review-graphignore` to exclude tracked files or when git isn't available.

Optional dependency groups:

```bash
pip install "code-review-graph[embeddings]"          # Local vector embeddings (sentence-transformers)
pip install "code-review-graph[google-embeddings]"   # Google Gemini embeddings
pip install "code-review-graph[communities]"         # Community detection (igraph)
pip install "code-review-graph[enrichment]"          # Python call-resolution enrichment (Jedi)
pip install "code-review-graph[eval]"                # Evaluation benchmarks (matplotlib)
pip install "code-review-graph[wiki]"                # Wiki generation with LLM summaries (ollama)
pip install "code-review-graph[all]"                 # All optional dependencies
```

OpenAI-compatible embeddings (real OpenAI, Azure, or any self-hosted gateway like
new-api / LiteLLM / vLLM / LocalAI / Ollama in openai mode) need no extra install —
just set the environment variables and pass `provider="openai"` to `embed_graph`:

```bash
export CRG_OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1     # or https://api.openai.com/v1
export CRG_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export CRG_OPENAI_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small          # whatever your gateway serves
# optional:
export CRG_OPENAI_DIMENSION=1536                        # pin dim (v3 models support reduction)
export CRG_OPENAI_BATCH_SIZE=100                        # lower for gateways with tight limits
                                                        # (e.g. Qwen text-embedding-v4 caps at 10)
```

The cloud-egress warning is auto-skipped when the base URL points to localhost
(`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `0.0.0.0`, `::1`).

> **Model selection tip.** Avoid `-preview` / `-beta` / `-exp` model IDs
> (e.g. `google/gemini-embedding-2-preview`) for anything you plan to keep
> long-term — preview models can change weights (different dimension → full
> re-embed required) or be deprecated without notice. Prefer stable GA
> releases such as `text-embedding-3-small` / `text-embedding-3-large` (OpenAI),
> `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` (via self-hosted vLLM / LocalAI), or
> `gemini-embedding-001` (via the native Gemini provider, which requires
> `GOOGLE_API_KEY` instead of the OpenAI-compatible path).
>
> `code-review-graph` embeds identifiers, signatures, structural context, and a
> bounded first-paragraph docstring/doc-comment summary. It does not transmit
> function bodies. Graphs created before documentation extraction was added
> need one full `code-review-graph build` before re-embedding so every file is
> reparsed. Routine builds never refresh embeddings by default. To refresh an
> existing index after a build, explicitly pass both `--embedding-provider`
> and `--embedding-model`; cloud choices may transmit this source-derived text
> and incur API cost.

#### Tool Filtering

CRG exposes 30 MCP tools by default. In token-constrained environments, you can
limit the server to a subset of tools using `--tools` or the `CRG_TOOLS`
environment variable:

```bash
# Via CLI flag
code-review-graph serve --tools query_graph_tool,semantic_search_nodes_tool,detect_changes_tool

# Via environment variable
CRG_TOOLS=query_graph_tool,semantic_search_nodes_tool code-review-graph serve
```

The CLI flag takes precedence over the environment variable. When neither is set,
all tools are available. This is especially useful for MCP client configurations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "code-review-graph": {
      "command": "code-review-graph",
      "args": ["serve", "--tools", "query_graph_tool,semantic_search_nodes_tool,detect_changes_tool,get_review_context_tool"]
    }
  }
}
```

## FAQ & how it compares

Short, honest answers in [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md):

- [vs LSP / language servers](docs/FAQ.md#how-is-this-different-from-lsp-and-language-servers) — one persistent cross-language graph instead of per-language daemons; LSP stays more precise per symbol.
- [vs RAG / embeddings](docs/FAQ.md#isnt-this-just-rag) — structural edges parsed from the AST, not similarity chunks; embeddings are optional and only assist search.
- [vs grep / agentic search](docs/FAQ.md#why-not-just-grep) — grep wins on one-hop lookups; the graph wins on multi-hop questions (impact radius, callers-of-callers, tests-for, affected flows).
- [vs Serena, codegraph, claude-context, repomix](docs/FAQ.md#how-does-it-compare-to-serena-codegraph-claude-context-and-repomix) — factual comparison table.
- [When NOT to use it](docs/FAQ.md#when-should-i-not-use-it) — small repos, trivial single-file diffs, one-off questions.
- [Does it phone home?](docs/FAQ.md#does-it-phone-home) — no; zero telemetry, cloud embeddings are opt-in.
- [How do I verify it is working?](docs/FAQ.md#how-do-i-verify-it-is-working) — `status`, `detect-changes --brief`, `/mcp`.

## Troubleshooting

### `pip` / `pipx` cannot download `hatchling` (or `Errno 9` / `Bad file descriptor` to PyPI)

Installing from a **source tree** (for example `pipx install .`) needs build dependencies from **PyPI** (for example `hatchling`). If you see `Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement hatchling` after connection warnings, the Python/pip in that **terminal** may not be able to open an HTTPS client to `pypi.org` (sometimes seen in an integrated editor terminal; less often system-wide with VPN, firewall, or proxy).

**Options:**

1. Run the same command from **macOS Terminal.app** (or iTerm) instead of the IDE’s terminal, then retry `pipx install .` or `pipx install "git+https://..."` .
2. Use **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** to install the CLI from a checkout (uses different download machinery than `pip` in many cases):

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/code-review-graph
   uv tool install . --force
   ```

3. For **development in a clone** without a global install, use `uv sync` and `uv run code-review-graph …` (or activate `.venv` after `uv sync`).

**Diagnose (optional):** `python3 scripts/diagnose_pypi_connectivity.py` — if it prints `FAILED`, the issue is environment/network, not a wrong package name in this repo.

### Windows Configuration Issues (Invalid JSON / Connection Closed)
If you are using Windows and encounter `Invalid JSON: EOF while parsing` or `MCP error -32000: Connection closed` when connecting via Claude Code, do not use the `cmd /c` wrapper in your config.

Ensure `fastmcp` is updated to at least `3.2.4+`. Then, configure your `~/.claude.json` to execute the `.exe` directly and pass the UTF-8 environment variable via the config:

```json
"code-review-graph": {
  "command": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\venv\\Scripts\\code-review-graph.exe",
  "args": ["serve", "--repo", "C:\\path\\to\\your\\project"],
  "env": { "PYTHONUTF8": "1" }
}
```
