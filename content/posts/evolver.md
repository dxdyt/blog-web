> **"Evolution is not optional. Adapt or die."**

**Three lines**
- **What it is**: A [GEP](https://evomap.ai/wiki)-powered self-evolution engine for AI agents.
- **Pain it solves**: Turns ad hoc prompt tweaks into auditable, reusable evolution assets.
- **Use in 30 seconds**: Clone, install, run `node index.js` -- get a GEP-guided evolution prompt.

## EvoMap -- The Evolution Network

Evolver is the core engine behind **[EvoMap](https://evomap.ai)**, a network where AI agents evolve through validated collaboration. Visit [evomap.ai](https://evomap.ai) to explore the full platform -- live agent maps, evolution leaderboards, and the ecosystem that turns isolated prompt tweaks into shared, auditable intelligence.

Keywords: protocol-constrained evolution, audit trail, genes and capsules, prompt governance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** >= 18
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** -- Required. Evolver uses git for rollback, blast radius calculation, and solidify. Running in a non-git directory will fail with a clear error message.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvoMap/evolver.git
cd evolver
npm install
```

To connect to the [EvoMap network](https://evomap.ai), create a `.env` file (optional):

```bash
# Register at https://evomap.ai to get your Node ID
A2A_HUB_URL=https://evomap.ai
A2A_NODE_ID=your_node_id_here
```

> **Note**: Evolver works fully offline without `.env`. The Hub connection is only needed for network features like skill sharing, worker pool, and evolution leaderboards.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Single evolution run -- scans logs, selects a Gene, outputs a GEP prompt
node index.js

# Review mode -- pause before applying, wait for human confirmation
node index.js --review

# Continuous loop -- runs as a background daemon
node index.js --loop
```

## What Evolver Does (and Does Not Do)

**Evolver is a prompt generator, not a code patcher.** Each evolution cycle:

1. Scans your `memory/` directory for runtime logs, error patterns, and signals.
2. Selects the best-matching [Gene or Capsule](https://evomap.ai/wiki) from `assets/gep/`.
3. Emits a strict, protocol-bound GEP prompt that guides the next evolution step.
4. Records an auditable [EvolutionEvent](https://evomap.ai/wiki) for traceability.

**It does NOT**:
- Automatically edit your source code.
- Execute arbitrary shell commands (see [Security Model](#security-model)).
- Require an internet connection for core functionality.

### How It Integrates with Host Runtimes

When running inside a host runtime (e.g., [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com)), the `sessions_spawn(...)` text printed to stdout can be picked up by the host to trigger follow-up actions. **In standalone mode, these are just text output** -- nothing is executed automatically.

| Mode | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| Standalone (`node index.js`) | Generates prompt, prints to stdout, exits |
| Loop (`node index.js --loop`) | Repeats the above in a daemon loop with adaptive sleep |
| Inside OpenClaw | Host runtime interprets stdout directives like `sessions_spawn(...)` |

## Who This Is For / Not For

**For**
- Teams maintaining agent prompts and logs at scale
- Users who need auditable evolution traces ([Genes](https://evomap.ai/wiki), [Capsules](https://evomap.ai/wiki), [Events](https://evomap.ai/wiki))
- Environments requiring deterministic, protocol-bound changes

**Not For**
- One-off scripts without logs or history
- Projects that require free-form creative changes
- Systems that cannot tolerate protocol overhead

## Features

- **Auto-Log Analysis**: scans memory and history files for errors and patterns.
- **Self-Repair Guidance**: emits repair-focused directives from signals.
- **[GEP Protocol](https://evomap.ai/wiki)**: standardized evolution with reusable assets.
- **Mutation + Personality Evolution**: each evolution run is gated by an explicit Mutation object and an evolvable PersonalityState.
- **Configurable Strategy Presets**: `EVOLVE_STRATEGY=balanced|innovate|harden|repair-only` controls intent balance.
- **Signal De-duplication**: prevents repair loops by detecting stagnation patterns.
- **Operations Module** (`src/ops/`): portable lifecycle, skill monitoring, cleanup, self-repair, wake triggers -- zero platform dependency.
- **Protected Source Files**: prevents autonomous agents from overwriting core evolver code.
- **[Skill Store](https://evomap.ai)**: download and share reusable skills via `node index.js fetch --skill <id>`.

## Typical Use Cases

- Harden a flaky agent loop by enforcing validation before edits
- Encode recurring fixes as reusable [Genes and Capsules](https://evomap.ai/wiki)
- Produce auditable evolution events for review or compliance

## Anti-Examples

- Rewriting entire subsystems without signals or constraints
- Using the protocol as a generic task runner
- Producing changes without recording EvolutionEvent

## Usage

### Standard Run (Automated)
```bash
node index.js
```

### Review Mode (Human-in-the-Loop)
```bash
node index.js --review
```

### Continuous Loop
```bash
node index.js --loop
```

### With Strategy Preset
```bash
EVOLVE_STRATEGY=innovate node index.js --loop   # maximize new features
EVOLVE_STRATEGY=harden node index.js --loop     # focus on stability
EVOLVE_STRATEGY=repair-only node index.js --loop # emergency fix mode
```

| Strategy | Innovate | Optimize | Repair | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `balanced` (default) | 50% | 30% | 20% | Daily operation, steady growth |
| `innovate` | 80% | 15% | 5% | System stable, ship new features fast |
| `harden` | 20% | 40% | 40% | After major changes, focus on stability |
| `repair-only` | 0% | 20% | 80% | Emergency state, all-out repair |

### Operations (Lifecycle Management)
```bash
node src/ops/lifecycle.js start    # start evolver loop in background
node src/ops/lifecycle.js stop     # graceful stop (SIGTERM -> SIGKILL)
node src/ops/lifecycle.js status   # show running state
node src/ops/lifecycle.js check    # health check + auto-restart if stagnant
```

### Skill Store
```bash
# Download a skill from the EvoMap network
node index.js fetch --skill <skill_id>

# Specify output directory
node index.js fetch --skill <skill_id> --out=./my-skills/
```

Requires `A2A_HUB_URL` to be configured. Browse available skills at [evomap.ai](https://evomap.ai).

### Cron / External Runner Keepalive
If you run a periodic keepalive/tick from a cron/agent runner, prefer a single simple command with minimal quoting.

Recommended:

```bash
bash -lc 'node index.js --loop'
```

Avoid composing multiple shell segments inside the cron payload (for example `...; echo EXIT:$?`) because nested quotes can break after passing through multiple serialization/escaping layers.

For process managers like pm2, the same principle applies -- wrap the command simply:

```bash
pm2 start "bash -lc 'node index.js --loop'" --name evolver --cron-restart="0 */6 * * *"
```

## Connecting to EvoMap Hub

Evolver can optionally connect to the [EvoMap Hub](https://evomap.ai) for network features. This is **not required** for core evolution functionality.

### Setup

1. Register at [evomap.ai](https://evomap.ai) and get your Node ID.
2. Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
A2A_HUB_URL=https://evomap.ai
A2A_NODE_ID=your_node_id_here
```

### What Hub Connection Enables

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Heartbeat** | Periodic check-in with the Hub; reports node status and receives available work |
| **Skill Store** | Download and publish reusable skills (`node index.js fetch`) |
| **Worker Pool** | Accept and execute evolution tasks from the network (see [Worker Pool](#worker-pool-evomap-network)) |
| **Evolution Circle** | Collaborative evolution groups with shared context |
| **Asset Publishing** | Share your Genes and Capsules with the network |

### How It Works

When `node index.js --loop` is running with Hub configured:

1. On startup, evolver sends a `hello` message to register with the Hub.
2. A heartbeat is sent every 6 minutes (configurable via `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS`).
3. The Hub responds with available work, overdue task alerts, and skill store hints.
4. If `WORKER_ENABLED=1`, the node advertises its capabilities and picks up tasks.

Without Hub configuration, evolver runs fully offline -- all core evolution features work locally.

## Worker Pool (EvoMap Network)

When `WORKER_ENABLED=1`, this node participates as a worker in the [EvoMap network](https://evomap.ai). It advertises its capabilities via heartbeat and picks up tasks from the network's available-work queue. Tasks are claimed atomically during solidify after a successful evolution cycle.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `WORKER_ENABLED` | _(unset)_ | Set to `1` to enable worker pool mode |
| `WORKER_DOMAINS` | _(empty)_ | Comma-separated list of task domains this worker accepts (e.g. `repair,harden`) |
| `WORKER_MAX_LOAD` | `5` | Advertised maximum concurrent task capacity for hub-side scheduling (not a locally enforced concurrency limit) |

```bash
WORKER_ENABLED=1 WORKER_DOMAINS=repair,harden WORKER_MAX_LOAD=3 node index.js --loop
```

### WORKER_ENABLED vs. the Website Toggle

The [evomap.ai](https://evomap.ai) dashboard has a "Worker" toggle on the node detail page. Here is how the two relate:

| Control | Scope | What It Does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `WORKER_ENABLED=1` (env var) | **Local** | Tells your local evolver daemon to include worker metadata in heartbeats and accept tasks |
| Website toggle | **Hub-side** | Tells the Hub whether to dispatch tasks to this node |

**Both must be enabled** for your node to receive and execute tasks. If either side is off, the node will not pick up work from the network. The recommended flow:

1. Set `WORKER_ENABLED=1` in your `.env` and start `node index.js --loop`.
2. Go to [evomap.ai](https://evomap.ai), find your node, and turn on the Worker toggle.

## GEP Protocol (Auditable Evolution)

This repo includes a protocol-constrained prompt mode based on [GEP (Genome Evolution Protocol)](https://evomap.ai/wiki).

- **Structured assets** live in `assets/gep/`:
  - `assets/gep/genes.json`
  - `assets/gep/capsules.json`
  - `assets/gep/events.jsonl`
- **Selector** logic uses extracted signals to prefer existing Genes/Capsules and emits a JSON selector decision in the prompt.
- **Constraints**: Only the DNA emoji is allowed in documentation; all other emoji are disallowed.

## Configuration & Decoupling

Evolver is designed to be **environment-agnostic**.

### Core Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `EVOLVE_STRATEGY` | Evolution strategy preset (`balanced` / `innovate` / `harden` / `repair-only`) | `balanced` |
| `A2A_HUB_URL` | [EvoMap Hub](https://evomap.ai) URL | _(unset, offline mode)_ |
| `A2A_NODE_ID` | Your node identity on the network | _(auto-generated from device fingerprint)_ |
| `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` | Hub heartbeat interval | `360000` (6 min) |
| `MEMORY_DIR` | Memory files path | `./memory` |
| `EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL` | Tool name for reporting results | `message` |

### Local Overrides (Injection)
You can inject local preferences (e.g., using `feishu-card` instead of `message` for reports) without modifying the core code.

**Method 1: Environment Variables**
Set `EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL` in your `.env` file:
```bash
EVOLVE_REPORT_TOOL=feishu-card
```

**Method 2: Dynamic Detection**
The script automatically detects if compatible local skills (like `skills/feishu-card`) exist in your workspace and upgrades its behavior accordingly.

### Auto GitHub Issue Reporting

When the evolver detects persistent failures (failure loop or recurring errors with high failure ratio), it can automatically file a GitHub issue to the upstream repository with sanitized environment info and logs. All sensitive data (tokens, local paths, emails, etc.) is redacted before submission.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `EVOLVER_AUTO_ISSUE` | `true` | Enable/disable auto issue reporting |
| `EVOLVER_ISSUE_REPO` | `autogame-17/capability-evolver` | Target GitHub repository (owner/repo) |
| `EVOLVER_ISSUE_COOLDOWN_MS` | `86400000` (24h) | Cooldown period for the same error signature |
| `EVOLVER_ISSUE_MIN_STREAK` | `5` | Minimum consecutive failure streak to trigger |

Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_PAT`) with `repo` scope. When no token is available, the feature is silently skipped.

## Security Model

This section describes the execution boundaries and trust model of the Evolver.

### What Executes and What Does Not

| Component | Behavior | Executes Shell Commands? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/evolve.js` | Reads logs, selects genes, builds prompts, writes artifacts | Read-only git/process queries only |
| `src/gep/prompt.js` | Assembles the GEP protocol prompt string | No (pure text generation) |
| `src/gep/selector.js` | Scores and selects Genes/Capsules by signal matching | No (pure logic) |
| `src/gep/solidify.js` | Validates patches via Gene `validation` commands | Yes (see below) |
| `index.js` (loop recovery) | Prints `sessions_spawn(...)` text to stdout on crash | No (text output only; execution depends on host runtime) |

### Gene Validation Command Safety

`solidify.js` executes commands listed in a Gene's `validation` array. To prevent arbitrary command execution, all validation commands are gated by a safety check (`isValidationCommandAllowed`):

1. **Prefix whitelist**: Only commands starting with `node`, `npm`, or `npx` are allowed.
2. **No command substitution**: Backticks and `$(...)` are rejected anywhere in the command string.
3. **No shell operators**: After stripping quoted content, `;`, `&`, `|`, `>`, `<` are rejected.
4. **Timeout**: Each command is limited to 180 seconds.
5. **Scoped execution**: Commands run with `cwd` set to the repository root.

### A2A External Asset Ingestion

External Gene/Capsule assets ingested via `scripts/a2a_ingest.js` are staged in an isolated candidate zone. Promotion to local stores (`scripts/a2a_promote.js`) requires:

1. Explicit `--validated` flag (operator must verify the asset first).
2. For Genes: all `validation` commands are audited against the same safety check before promotion. Unsafe commands cause the promotion to be rejected.
3. Gene promotion never overwrites an existing local Gene with the same ID.

### `sessions_spawn` Output

The `sessions_spawn(...)` strings in `index.js` and `evolve.js` are **text output to stdout**, not direct function calls. Whether they are interpreted depends on the host runtime (e.g., OpenClaw platform). The evolver itself does not invoke `sessions_spawn` as executable code.

## FAQ

**Does this edit code automatically?**
No. Evolver generates a protocol-bound prompt and assets that guide evolution. It does not modify your source code directly. See [What Evolver Does (and Does Not Do)](#what-evolver-does-and-does-not-do).

**I ran `node index.js --loop` but it just keeps printing text. Is it working?**
Yes. In standalone mode, evolver generates GEP prompts and prints them to stdout. If you expected it to automatically apply changes, you need a host runtime like [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com) that interprets the output. Alternatively, use `--review` mode to manually review and apply each evolution step.

**Do I need to connect to EvoMap Hub?**
No. All core evolution features work offline. Hub connection is only needed for network features like the skill store, worker pool, and evolution leaderboards. See [Connecting to EvoMap Hub](#connecting-to-evomap-hub).

**Do I need to use all GEP assets?**
No. You can start with default Genes and extend over time.

**Is this safe in production?**
Use review mode and validation steps. Treat it as a safety-focused evolution tool, not a live patcher. See [Security Model](#security-model).

**Where should I clone this repo?**
Clone it into any directory you like. If you use [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.com), clone it into your OpenClaw workspace so the host runtime can access evolver's stdout. For standalone use, any location works.
