## What is Voicebox?

Voicebox is a **local-first voice cloning studio** — a free and open-source alternative to ElevenLabs. Clone voices from a few seconds of audio, generate speech in 23 languages across 5 TTS engines, apply post-processing effects, and compose multi-voice projects with a timeline editor.

- **Complete privacy** — models and voice data stay on your machine
- **5 TTS engines** — Qwen3-TTS, LuxTTS, Chatterbox Multilingual, Chatterbox Turbo, and HumeAI TADA
- **23 languages** — from English to Arabic, Japanese, Hindi, Swahili, and more
- **Post-processing effects** — pitch shift, reverb, delay, chorus, compression, and filters
- **Expressive speech** — paralinguistic tags like `[laugh]`, `[sigh]`, `[gasp]` via Chatterbox Turbo
- **Unlimited length** — auto-chunking with crossfade for scripts, articles, and chapters
- **Stories editor** — multi-track timeline for conversations, podcasts, and narratives
- **API-first** — REST API for integrating voice synthesis into your own projects
- **Native performance** — built with Tauri (Rust), not Electron
- **Runs everywhere** — macOS (MLX/Metal), Windows (CUDA), Linux, AMD ROCm, Intel Arc, Docker

## Features

### Multi-Engine Voice Cloning

Five TTS engines with different strengths, switchable per-generation:

| Engine                      | Languages | Strengths                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qwen3-TTS** (0.6B / 1.7B) | 10        | High-quality multilingual cloning, delivery instructions ("speak slowly", "whisper")                                                     |
| **LuxTTS**                  | English   | Lightweight (~1GB VRAM), 48kHz output, 150x realtime on CPU                                                                              |
| **Chatterbox Multilingual** | 23        | Broadest language coverage — Arabic, Danish, Finnish, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Swahili, Swedish, Turkish and more |
| **Chatterbox Turbo**        | English   | Fast 350M model with paralinguistic emotion/sound tags                                                                                   |
| **TADA** (1B / 3B)          | 10        | HumeAI speech-language model — 700s+ coherent audio, text-acoustic dual alignment                                                        |

### Emotions & Paralinguistic Tags

Type `/` in the text input to insert expressive tags that the model synthesizes inline with speech (Chatterbox Turbo):

`[laugh]` `[chuckle]` `[gasp]` `[cough]` `[sigh]` `[groan]` `[sniff]` `[shush]` `[clear throat]`

### Post-Processing Effects

8 audio effects powered by Spotify's `pedalboard` library. Apply after generation, preview in real time, build reusable presets.

| Effect           | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pitch Shift      | Up or down by up to 12 semitones              |
| Reverb           | Configurable room size, damping, wet/dry mix  |
| Delay            | Echo with adjustable time, feedback, and mix  |
| Chorus / Flanger | Modulated delay for metallic or lush textures |
| Compressor       | Dynamic range compression                     |
| Gain             | Volume adjustment (-40 to +40 dB)             |
| High-Pass Filter | Remove low frequencies                        |
| Low-Pass Filter  | Remove high frequencies                       |

Ships with 4 built-in presets (Robotic, Radio, Echo Chamber, Deep Voice) and supports custom presets. Effects can be assigned per-profile as defaults.

### Unlimited Generation Length

Text is automatically split at sentence boundaries and each chunk is generated independently, then crossfaded together. Works with all engines.

- Configurable auto-chunking limit (100–5,000 chars)
- Crossfade slider (0–200ms) for smooth transitions
- Max text length: 50,000 characters
- Smart splitting respects abbreviations, CJK punctuation, and `[tags]`

### Generation Versions

Every generation supports multiple versions with provenance tracking:

- **Original** — clean TTS output, always preserved
- **Effects versions** — apply different effects chains from any source version
- **Takes** — regenerate with a new seed for variation
- **Source tracking** — each version records its lineage
- **Favorites** — star generations for quick access

### Async Generation Queue

Generation is non-blocking. Submit and immediately start typing the next one.

- Serial execution queue prevents GPU contention
- Real-time SSE status streaming
- Failed generations can be retried
- Stale generations from crashes auto-recover on startup

### Voice Profile Management

- Create profiles from audio files or record directly in-app
- Import/export profiles to share or back up
- Multi-sample support for higher quality cloning
- Per-profile default effects chains
- Organize with descriptions and language tags

### Stories Editor

Multi-voice timeline editor for conversations, podcasts, and narratives.

- Multi-track composition with drag-and-drop
- Inline audio trimming and splitting
- Auto-playback with synchronized playhead
- Version pinning per track clip

### Recording & Transcription

- In-app recording with waveform visualization
- System audio capture (macOS and Windows)
- Automatic transcription powered by Whisper (including Whisper Turbo)
- Export recordings in multiple formats

### Model Management

- Per-model unload to free GPU memory without deleting downloads
- Custom models directory via `VOICEBOX_MODELS_DIR`
- Model folder migration with progress tracking
- Download cancel/clear UI

### GPU Support

| Platform                 | Backend        | Notes                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon)    | MLX (Metal)    | 4-5x faster via Neural Engine                  |
| Windows / Linux (NVIDIA) | PyTorch (CUDA) | Auto-downloads CUDA binary from within the app |
| Linux (AMD)              | PyTorch (ROCm) | Auto-configures HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION       |
| Windows (any GPU)        | DirectML       | Universal Windows GPU support                  |
| Intel Arc                | IPEX/XPU       | Intel discrete GPU acceleration                |
| Any                      | CPU            | Works everywhere, just slower                  |

## Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed setup and contribution guidelines.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamiepine/voicebox.git
cd voicebox

just setup   # creates Python venv, installs all deps
just dev     # starts backend + desktop app
```

Install [just](https://github.com/casey/just): `brew install just` or `cargo install just`. Run `just --list` to see all commands.

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh), [Rust](https://rustup.rs), [Python 3.11+](https://python.org), [Tauri Prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/), and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on macOS.

### Building Locally

```bash
just build          # Build CPU server binary + Tauri app
just build-local    # (Windows) Build CPU + CUDA server binaries + Tauri app
```

### Adding New Voice Models

The multi-engine architecture makes adding new TTS engines straightforward. A [step-by-step guide](docs/content/docs/developer/tts-engines.mdx) covers the full process: dependency research, backend protocol implementation, frontend wiring, and PyInstaller bundling.

The guide is optimized for AI coding agents. An [agent skill](.agents/skills/add-tts-engine/SKILL.md) can pick up a model name and handle the entire integration autonomously — you just test the build locally.
