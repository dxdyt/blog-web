Welcome to the [HCB](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/) codebase!

## What is HCB?

HCB is an [open source](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/open-source/),
safe, and easy-to-use fiscal sponsorship platform for hackathons, Hack Clubs,
robotic teams and more. We use it to run
our [fiscal sponsorship program](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/), we
provide high schoolers with a 501(c)(3) status-backed restricted fund for their
organization. Behind the scenes, HCB is a Ruby on Rails application (learn more
by reading [our documentation](/dev-docs)).
