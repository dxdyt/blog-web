# Flutter Agent Skills

Agent skills for Flutter, maintained by the Flutter team.
A collection of skills providing tailored instructions for happy path Flutter app development workflows. By giving the agent actual domain expertise and repeatable workflows, you drastically reduce mistakes and ensure agents reliably complete the task following best practices.

Skills are essentially simple folders of files that can be seen as complementary to MCP, where MCP gives an agent access to specialized tools and a Skill teaches the agent “how” to use tools for a specific task.

You can also install the [Agent Skills for Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang/skills) for Dart tasks.

## Installation

To install all skills into your project, run the following command. 
The `--agent universal` flag puts it in the standard `.agents/skills` 
folder that most agents use.

```bash
npx skills add flutter/skills --skill '*' --agent universal
```

## Updating Skills

To update, run the following command:

```bash
npx skills update
```
