### VS Code / VS Code Insiders (Preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> VS Code plugin support is a preview feature and subject to change. You may need to enable it first.

```jsonc
// settings.json
{
  "chat.plugins.enabled": true,
  "chat.plugins.marketplaces": ["dotnet/skills"]
}
```

Once configured, type `/plugins` in Copilot Chat or use the `@agentPlugins` filter in Extensions to browse and install plugins from the marketplace.

### Cursor

This repository is a [Cursor plugin marketplace](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins). You can discover and install published plugins directly in Cursor:

1. Open the marketplace panel in Cursor
2. Search for `.NET` or browse [cursor.com/marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace)
3. Install the desired plugins

For local development or unpublished changes, import plugins from a local checkout:

1. Copy or symlink your local checkout to `~/.cursor/plugins/local/dotnet-agent-skills`
2. Restart Cursor or run **Developer: Reload Window**

### Codex CLI

Skills in this repository follow the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard
and are compatible with [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills).

#### Plugin marketplace (recommended)

Codex CLI v0.121.0 and later supports a [plugin marketplace](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins).
This repository ships a Codex-native marketplace manifest at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`,
so you can register `dotnet/skills` as a marketplace and install plugins from it directly.

1. Add the marketplace:
   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace add dotnet/skills
   ```
2. Launch Codex and open the plugin browser:
   ```
   /plugins
   ```
3. Browse the `dotnet-agent-skills` tab and install the desired plugins.
4. Update plugins on demand:
   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace upgrade dotnet-agent-skills
   ```

#### Individual skills

You can also install individual skills using the `skill-installer` CLI with the GitHub URL:

```bash
$ skill-installer install https://github.com/dotnet/skills/tree/main/plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>
```
