## 🎯 What is Shannon?

Shannon is an AI pentester that delivers actual exploits, not just alerts.

Shannon's goal is to break your web app before someone else does. It autonomously hunts for attack vectors in your code, then uses its built-in browser to execute real exploits, such as injection attacks, and auth bypass, to prove the vulnerability is actually exploitable.

**What Problem Does Shannon Solve?**

Thanks to tools like Claude Code and Cursor, your team ships code non-stop. But your penetration test? That happens once a year. This creates a *massive* security gap. For the other 364 days, you could be unknowingly shipping vulnerabilities to production.

Shannon closes this gap by acting as your on-demand whitebox pentester. It doesn't just find potential issues. It executes real exploits, providing concrete proof of vulnerabilities. This lets you ship with confidence, knowing every build can be secured.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** - Container runtime ([Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **AI Provider Credentials** (choose one):
  - **Anthropic API key** (recommended) - Get from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
  - **Claude Code OAuth token**
  - **[EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Alternative providers via Router Mode** - OpenAI or Google Gemini via OpenRouter (see [Router Mode](#experimental---unsupported-router-mode-alternative-providers))

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone Shannon
git clone https://github.com/KeygraphHQ/shannon.git
cd shannon

# 2. Configure credentials (choose one method)

# Option A: Export environment variables
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"              # or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN

# Option B: Create a .env file
cat > .env << 'EOF'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
EOF

# 3. Run a pentest
./shannon start URL=https://your-app.com REPO=your-repo
```

Shannon will build the containers, start the workflow, and return a workflow ID. The pentest runs in the background.

### Monitoring Progress

```bash
# View real-time worker logs
./shannon logs

# Query a specific workflow's progress
./shannon query ID=shannon-1234567890

# Open the Temporal Web UI for detailed monitoring
open http://localhost:8233
```

### Stopping Shannon

```bash
# Stop all containers (preserves workflow data)
./shannon stop

# Full cleanup (removes all data)
./shannon stop CLEAN=true
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic pentest
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name

# With a configuration file
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name CONFIG=./configs/my-config.yaml

# Custom output directory
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name OUTPUT=./my-reports
```

### Prepare Your Repository

Shannon expects target repositories to be placed under the `./repos/` directory at the project root. The `REPO` flag refers to a folder name inside `./repos/`. Copy the repository you want to scan into `./repos/`, or clone it directly there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git ./repos/your-repo
```

**For monorepos:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-monorepo.git ./repos/your-monorepo
```

**For multi-repository applications** (e.g., separate frontend/backend):

```bash
mkdir ./repos/your-app
cd ./repos/your-app
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/backend.git
git clone https://github.com/your-org/api.git
```

### Platform-Specific Instructions

**For Linux (Native Docker):**

You may need to run commands with `sudo` depending on your Docker setup. If you encounter permission issues with output files, ensure your user has access to the Docker socket.

**For macOS:**

Works out of the box with Docker Desktop installed.

**Testing Local Applications:**

Docker containers cannot reach `localhost` on your host machine. Use `host.docker.internal` in place of `localhost`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 REPO=repo-name
```

### Configuration (Optional)

While you can run without a config file, creating one enables authenticated testing and customized analysis. Place your configuration files inside the `./configs/` directory — this folder is mounted into the Docker container automatically.

#### Create Configuration File

Copy and modify the example configuration:

```bash
cp configs/example-config.yaml configs/my-app-config.yaml
```

#### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
authentication:
  login_type: form
  login_url: "https://your-app.com/login"
  credentials:
    username: "test@example.com"
    password: "yourpassword"
    totp_secret: "LB2E2RX7XFHSTGCK"  # Optional for 2FA

  login_flow:
    - "Type $username into the email field"
    - "Type $password into the password field"
    - "Click the 'Sign In' button"

  success_condition:
    type: url_contains
    value: "/dashboard"

rules:
  avoid:
    - description: "AI should avoid testing logout functionality"
      type: path
      url_path: "/logout"

  focus:
    - description: "AI should emphasize testing API endpoints"
      type: path
      url_path: "/api"
```

#### TOTP Setup for 2FA

If your application uses two-factor authentication, simply add the TOTP secret to your config file. The AI will automatically generate the required codes during testing.

### [EXPERIMENTAL - UNSUPPORTED] Router Mode (Alternative Providers)

Shannon can experimentally route requests through alternative AI providers using claude-code-router. This mode is not officially supported and is intended primarily for:

* **Model experimentation** — try Shannon with GPT-5.2 or Gemini 3–family models

#### Quick Setup

1. Add your provider API key to `.env`:

```bash
# Choose one provider:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

# Set default model:
ROUTER_DEFAULT=openai,gpt-5.2  # provider,model format
```

2. Run with `ROUTER=true`:

```bash
./shannon start URL=https://example.com REPO=repo-name ROUTER=true
```

#### Experimental Models

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| OpenAI | gpt-5.2, gpt-5-mini |
| OpenRouter | google/gemini-3-flash-preview |

#### Disclaimer

This feature is experimental and unsupported. Output quality depends heavily on the model. Shannon is built on top of the Anthropic Agent SDK and is optimized and primarily tested with Anthropic Claude models. Alternative providers may produce inconsistent results (including failing early phases like Recon) depending on the model and routing setup.

### Output and Results

All results are saved to `./audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/` by default. Use `--output <path>` to specify a custom directory.

Output structure:
```
audit-logs/{hostname}_{sessionId}/
├── session.json          # Metrics and session data
├── agents/               # Per-agent execution logs
├── prompts/              # Prompt snapshots for reproducibility
└── deliverables/
    └── comprehensive_security_assessment_report.md   # Final comprehensive security report
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Shannon emulates a human penetration tester's methodology using a sophisticated multi-agent architecture. It combines white-box source code analysis with black-box dynamic exploitation across four distinct phases:

```

### Architectural Overview

Shannon is engineered to emulate the methodology of a human penetration tester. It leverages Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK as its core reasoning engine, but its true strength lies in the sophisticated multi-agent architecture built around it. This architecture combines the deep context of **white-box source code analysis** with the real-world validation of **black-box dynamic exploitation**, managed by an orchestrator through four distinct phases to ensure a focus on minimal false positives and intelligent context management.

---

#### **Phase 1: Reconnaissance**

The first phase builds a comprehensive map of the application's attack surface. Shannon analyzes the source code and integrates with tools like Nmap and Subfinder to understand the tech stack and infrastructure. Simultaneously, it performs live application exploration via browser automation to correlate code-level insights with real-world behavior, producing a detailed map of all entry points, API endpoints, and authentication mechanisms for the next phase.

#### **Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis**

To maximize efficiency, this phase operates in parallel. Using the reconnaissance data, specialized agents for each OWASP category hunt for potential flaws in parallel. For vulnerabilities like Injection and SSRF, agents perform a structured data flow analysis, tracing user input to dangerous sinks. This phase produces a key deliverable: a list of **hypothesized exploitable paths** that are passed on for validation.

#### **Phase 3: Exploitation**

Continuing the parallel workflow to maintain speed, this phase is dedicated entirely to turning hypotheses into proof. Dedicated exploit agents receive the hypothesized paths and attempt to execute real-world attacks using browser automation, command-line tools, and custom scripts. This phase enforces a strict **"No Exploit, No Report"** policy: if a hypothesis cannot be successfully exploited to demonstrate impact, it is discarded as a false positive.

#### **Phase 4: Reporting**

The final phase compiles all validated findings into a professional, actionable report. An agent consolidates the reconnaissance data and the successful exploit evidence, cleaning up any noise or hallucinated artifacts. Only verified vulnerabilities are included, complete with **reproducible, copy-and-paste Proof-of-Concepts**, delivering a final pentest-grade report focused exclusively on proven risks.


## 📋 Coverage and Roadmap

For detailed information about Shannon's security testing coverage and development roadmap, see our [Coverage and Roadmap](./COVERAGE.md) documentation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimers

### Important Usage Guidelines & Disclaimers

Please review the following guidelines carefully before using Shannon (Lite). As a user, you are responsible for your actions and assume all liability.

#### **1. Potential for Mutative Effects & Environment Selection**

This is not a passive scanner. The exploitation agents are designed to **actively execute attacks** to confirm vulnerabilities. This process can have mutative effects on the target application and its data.

> [!WARNING]
> **⚠️ DO NOT run Shannon on production environments.**
>
> - It is intended exclusively for use on sandboxed, staging, or local development environments where data integrity is not a concern.
> - Potential mutative effects include, but are not limited to: creating new users, modifying or deleting data, compromising test accounts, and triggering unintended side effects from injection attacks.

#### **2. Legal & Ethical Use**

Shannon is designed for legitimate security auditing purposes only.

> [!CAUTION]
> **You must have explicit, written authorization** from the owner of the target system before running Shannon.
>
> Unauthorized scanning and exploitation of systems you do not own is illegal and can be prosecuted under laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Keygraph is not responsible for any misuse of Shannon.

#### **3. LLM & Automation Caveats**

- **Verification is Required**: While significant engineering has gone into our "proof-by-exploitation" methodology to eliminate false positives, the underlying LLMs can still generate hallucinated or weakly-supported content in the final report. **Human oversight is essential** to validate the legitimacy and severity of all reported findings.
- **Comprehensiveness**: The analysis in Shannon Lite may not be exhaustive due to the inherent limitations of LLM context windows. For a more comprehensive, graph-based analysis of your entire codebase, **Shannon Pro** leverages its advanced data flow analysis engine to ensure deeper and more thorough coverage.

#### **4. Scope of Analysis**

- **Targeted Vulnerabilities**: The current version of Shannon Lite specifically targets the following classes of *exploitable* vulnerabilities:
  - Broken Authentication & Authorization
  - Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **What Shannon Lite Does Not Cover**: This list is not exhaustive of all potential security risks. Shannon Lite's "proof-by-exploitation" model means it will not report on issues it cannot actively exploit, such as vulnerable third-party libraries or insecure configurations. These types of deep static-analysis findings are a core focus of the advanced analysis engine in **Shannon Pro**.

#### **5. Cost & Performance**

- **Time**: As of the current version, a full test run typically takes **1 to 1.5 hours** to complete.
- **Cost**: Running the full test using Anthropic's Claude 4.5 Sonnet model may incur costs of approximately **$50 USD**. Costs vary based on model pricing and application complexity.

#### **6. Windows Antivirus False Positives**

Windows Defender may flag files in `xben-benchmark-results/` or `deliverables/` as malware. These are false positives caused by exploit code in the reports. Add an exclusion for the Shannon directory in Windows Defender, or use Docker/WSL2.


## 📜 License

Shannon Lite is released under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)](LICENSE).

Shannon is open source (AGPL v3). This license allows you to:
- Use it freely for all internal security testing.
- Modify the code privately for internal use without sharing your changes.

The AGPL's sharing requirements primarily apply to organizations offering Shannon as a public or managed service (such as a SaaS platform). In those specific cases, any modifications made to the core software must be open-sourced.
