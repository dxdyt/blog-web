[![ShadowBroker](/uploads/46f99d19fa141a2efba37feee9de8aab/Title.jpg)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/248208ec-62f7-49d1-831d-4bd0a1fa6852)





**ShadowBroker** is a decentralized intelligence platform that aggregates real-time, multi-domain OSINT telemetry from 60+ live intelligence feeds into a single dark-ops map interface. Aircraft, ships, satellites, conflict zones, CCTV networks, GPS jamming, internet-connected devices, police scanners, mesh radio nodes, and breaking geopolitical events — all updating in real time on one screen as well as an obfuscated communications protocol and information exchange infrastructure.

Built with **Next.js**, **MapLibre GL**, **FastAPI**, and **Python**. 35+ toggleable data layers, including SAR ground-change detection. Multiple visual modes (DEFAULT / SATELLITE / FLIR / NVG / CRT). Right-click any point on Earth for a country dossier, head-of-state lookup, and the latest Sentinel-2 satellite photo. No user data is collected or transmitted — the dashboard runs entirely in your browser against a self-hosted backend.

Designed for analysts, researchers, radio operators, and anyone who wants to see what the world looks like when every public signal is on the same map.


## Why This Exists

A surprising amount of global telemetry is already public — aircraft ADS-B broadcasts, maritime AIS signals, satellite orbital data, earthquake sensors, mesh radio networks, police scanner feeds, environmental monitoring stations, internet infrastructure telemetry, and more. This data is scattered across dozens of tools and APIs. ShadowBroker combines all of it into a single interface.

The project does not introduce new surveillance capabilities — it aggregates and visualizes existing public datasets. It is fully open-source so anyone can audit exactly what data is accessed and how. No user data is collected or transmitted — everything runs locally against a self-hosted backend. No telemetry, no analytics, no accounts.

### Shodan Connector

ShadowBroker includes an optional Shodan connector for operator-supplied API access. Shodan results are fetched with your own `SHODAN_API_KEY`, rendered as a local investigative overlay (not merged into core feeds), and remain subject to Shodan’s terms of service.

## Interesting Use Cases

* **Track Air Force One**, the private jets of billionaires and dictators, and every military tanker, ISR, and fighter broadcasting ADS-B. Air Force One and all of the accompanying Presidential/Vice Presidential planes are highlighted and monitored from the moment they leave the ground. 
* **Connect an AI agent as a co-analyst** through ShadowBroker's HMAC-signed agentic command channel — supports OpenClaw and any other agent that speaks the protocol (Claude, GPT, LangChain, custom). The agent gets full read/write access to all 35+ data layers, pin placement, map control, SAR ground-change, mesh networking, and alert delivery. It sees everything the operator sees and can take actions on the map in real time.
* **Communicate on the InfoNet testnet** — The first decentralized intelligence mesh built into an OSINT tool. Obfuscated messaging with gate personas, Dead Drop peer-to-peer exchange, and a built-in terminal CLI. No accounts, no signup. Privacy is not guaranteed yet — this is an experimental testnet — but the protocol is live and being hardened.
* **Right-click anywhere on Earth** for a country dossier (head of state, population, languages), Wikipedia summary, and the latest Sentinel-2 satellite photo at 10m resolution
* **Click a KiwiSDR node** and tune into live shortwave radio directly in the dashboard. Click a police scanner feed and eavesdrop in one click.
* **Watch 11,000+ CCTV cameras** across 6 countries — London, NYC, California, Spain, Singapore, and more — streaming live on the map
* **See GPS jamming zones** in real time — derived from NAC-P degradation analysis of aircraft transponder data
* **Monitor satellites overhead** color-coded by mission type — military recon, SIGINT, SAR, early warning, space stations — with SatNOGS and TinyGS ground station networks
* **Track naval traffic** including 25,000+ AIS vessels, fishing activity via Global Fishing Watch, and billionaire superyachts
* **Follow earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, active wildfires** (NASA FIRMS), severe weather alerts, and air quality readings worldwide
* **Map military bases, 35,000+ power plants**, 2,000+ data centers, and internet outage regions — cross-referenced automatically
* **Connect to Meshtastic mesh radio nodes** and APRS amateur radio networks — visible on the map and integrated into Mesh Chat
* **Detect ground changes through cloud cover** with SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) — mm-scale ground deformation, flood extent, vegetation disturbance, and damage assessments from NASA OPERA and Copernicus EGMS. Define your own watch areas and get anomaly alerts. Free with a NASA Earthdata account.
* **Switch visual modes** — DEFAULT, SATELLITE, FLIR (thermal), NVG (night vision), CRT (retro terminal) — via the STYLE button
* **Track trains** across the US (Amtrak) and Europe (DigiTraffic) in real time
* **Estimate where US aircraft carriers are** using automated GDELT news scraping — no other open tool does this
* **Search internet-connected devices worldwide** via Shodan — cameras, SCADA systems, databases — plotted as a live overlay on the map

## ⚡ Quick Start (Docker)

### From GitHub (default — uses GHCR images)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigbodycobain/Shadowbroker.git
cd Shadowbroker
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### From GitLab (uses GitLab Container Registry)

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/bigbodycobain/Shadowbroker.git
cd Shadowbroker
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gitlab.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gitlab.yml up -d
```

Both paths produce identical containers — same source, same CI, same images byte-for-byte. Pick whichever ecosystem you already use.

Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard! *(Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or Docker Engine)*

> **Backend port already in use?** The browser only needs port `3000`, but the backend API is also published on host port `8000` for local diagnostics. If another app already uses `8000`, create or edit `.env` next to `docker-compose.yml` and set `BACKEND_PORT=8001`, then run `docker compose up -d`.

> **Blank news/UAP/bases/wastewater after several minutes?** Check for backend OOM restarts with `docker events --since 30m --filter container=shadowbroker-backend --filter event=oom`. The default compose file gives the backend 4GB; if your host has less memory, reduce enabled feeds or set `BACKEND_MEMORY_LIMIT=3G` and expect slower/heavier layers to warm more gradually.

> **Podman users:** Podman works, but `podman compose` is a wrapper and still needs a Compose provider installed. On Windows/WSL, if you see `looking up compose provider failed`, install `podman-compose` and run `podman-compose pull` followed by `podman-compose up -d` from inside the cloned `Shadowbroker` folder. On Linux/macOS/WSL shells you can also use `./compose.sh --engine podman pull` and `./compose.sh --engine podman up -d`.

---

##  🔄 **How to Update**

ShadowBroker uses pre-built Docker images — no local building required. Updating takes seconds:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

That's it. `pull` grabs the latest images, `up -d` restarts the containers.

> **Coming from an older version?** Pull the latest repo code first, then pull images:
>
> ```bash
> git pull origin main
> docker compose down
> docker compose pull
> docker compose up -d
> ```
>
> Podman users should run the equivalent provider command, for example `podman-compose pull` and `podman-compose up -d`, or use `./compose.sh --engine podman pull` and `./compose.sh --engine podman up -d` from a bash-compatible shell.

### ⚠️ **Stuck on the old version?**

**If `git pull` fails or `docker compose up` keeps building from source instead of pulling images**, your clone predates a March 2026 repository migration that rewrote commit history. A normal `git pull` cannot fix this. Run:

```bash
# Back up any local config you want to keep (.env, etc.)
cd ..
rm -rf Shadowbroker
git clone https://github.com/bigbodycobain/Shadowbroker.git
cd Shadowbroker
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

**How to tell if you're affected:** If `docker compose up` shows `RUN apt-get`, `RUN npm ci`, or `RUN pip install` — it's building from source instead of pulling pre-built images. You need a fresh clone.

**Other troubleshooting:**

* **Force re-pull:** `docker compose pull --no-cache`
* **Prune old images:** `docker image prune -f`
* **Check logs:** `docker compose logs -f backend`

---

### **☸️ Kubernetes / Helm (Advanced)**

For high-availability deployments or home-lab clusters, ShadowBroker supports deployment via **Helm**. This chart is based on the `bjw-s-labs` template and provides a robust, modular setup for both the backend and frontend.

**1. Add the Repository:**
```bash
helm repo add bjw-s-labs https://bjw-s-labs.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
```

**2. Install the Chart:**
```bash
# Default — pulls images from GHCR
helm install shadowbroker ./helm/chart --create-namespace --namespace shadowbroker

# GitLab registry variant
helm install shadowbroker ./helm/chart --create-namespace --namespace shadowbroker \
  -f helm/chart/values.yaml \
  -f helm/chart/values-gitlab.yaml
```

**3. Key Features:**
*   **Modular Architecture:** Individually scale the intelligence backend and the HUD frontend.
*   **Security Context:** Runs with restricted UIDs (1001) for container hardening.
*   **Ingress Ready:** Compatible with Traefik, Cert-Manager, and Gateway API for secure, external access to your intelligence node.

*Special thanks to [@chr0n1x](https://github.com/chr0n1x) for contributing the initial Kubernetes architecture.*

## Experimental Testnet — No Privacy Guarantee

ShadowBroker v0.9.7 ships **InfoNet** (decentralized intelligence mesh + Sovereign Shell governance economy), an **agentic AI command channel** (supports OpenClaw and any HMAC-signing agent), **Time Machine snapshot playback**, and **SAR satellite ground-change detection**. This is an **experimental testnet** — not a private messenger and not a production governance system.

| Channel | Privacy Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Meshtastic / APRS** | **PUBLIC** | RF radio transmissions are public and interceptable by design. |
| **InfoNet Gate Chat** | **OBFUSCATED** | Messages are obfuscated with gate personas and canonical payload signing, but NOT end-to-end encrypted. Metadata is not hidden. |
| **Dead Drop DMs** | **STRONGEST CURRENT LANE** | Token-based epoch mailbox with SAS word verification. Strongest lane in this build, but not yet confidently private. |
| **Sovereign Shell governance** | **PUBLIC LEDGER** | Petitions, votes, upgrade hashes, and dispute stakes are signed events on a public hashchain. Pseudonymous via gate persona, but governance actions are intentionally observable. |
| **Privacy primitives (RingCT / stealth / DEX)** | **NOT YET WIRED** | Locked Protocol contracts are in place, but the cryptographic scheme has not been chosen. The privacy-core Rust crate is the integration target for a future sprint. |

**Do not transmit anything sensitive on any channel.** Treat all lanes as open and public for now. E2E encryption and deeper native/Tauri hardening are the next milestones. If you fork this project, keep these labels intact and do not make stronger privacy claims than the implementation supports.

> **For a full picture of what the mesh actually defends against and
> what it doesn't, read the
> [threat model](docs/mesh/threat-model.md) and the
> [claims reconciliation](docs/mesh/claims-reconciliation.md). Every

## ✨ Features

### 🧅 InfoNet — Decentralized Intelligence Mesh + Sovereign Shell (expanded in v0.9.7)

The first decentralized intelligence communication and governance layer built directly into an OSINT platform. No accounts, no signup, no identity required. v0.9.7 promotes InfoNet from a chat layer into a full governance economy with a clear path to a privacy-preserving decentralized intelligence platform.

**Communication layer (since v0.9.6):**

* **InfoNet Experimental Testnet** — A global, obfuscated message relay. Anyone running ShadowBroker can transmit and receive on the InfoNet. Messages pass through a Wormhole relay layer with gate personas, Ed25519 canonical payload signing, and transport obfuscation.
* **Mesh Chat Panel** — Three-tab interface: **INFONET** (gate chat with obfuscated transport), **MESH** (Meshtastic radio integration), **DEAD DROP** (peer-to-peer message exchange with token-based epoch mailboxes — strongest current lane).
* **Gate Persona System** — Pseudonymous identities with Ed25519 signing keys, prekey bundles, SAS word contact verification, and abuse reporting.
* **Mesh Terminal** — Built-in CLI: `send`, `dm`, market commands, gate state inspection. Draggable panel, minimizes to the top bar. Type `help` to see all commands.
* **Crypto Stack** — Ed25519 signing, X25519 Diffie-Hellman, AESGCM encryption with HKDF key derivation, hash chain commitment system. Double-ratchet DM scaffolding in progress.

**Sovereign Shell — governance economy (NEW in v0.9.7):**

* **Petitions + Governance DSL** — On-chain parameter changes via signed petitions. Type-safe payload executor for `UPDATE_PARAM`, `BATCH_UPDATE_PARAMS`, `ENABLE_FEATURE`, and `DISABLE_FEATURE`. Tunable knobs change by vote — no code deploys required.
* **Upgrade-Hash Governance** — Protocol upgrades that need new logic (not just parameter changes) vote on a SHA-256 hash of the verified release. 80% supermajority, 40% quorum, 67% Heavy-Node activation. Lifecycle: signatures → voting → challenge window → awaiting readiness → activated.
* **Resolution & Dispute Markets** — Stake on market resolution outcomes (yes / no / data_unavailable), open disputes with bonded evidence, and stake on dispute confirm-or-reverse. Per-row submission state stays isolated so concurrent actions don't share an in-flight slot.
* **Evidence Submission** — Bonded evidence bundles with client-side SHA-256 canonicalization that matches Python `repr()` exactly, so hashes round-trip cleanly through the chain.
* **Gate Suspension / Shutdown / Appeals** — Filing forms for suspending or shutting down a gate, with a reusable appeal flow auto-targeting the pending petition.
* **Bootstrap Eligible-Node-One-Vote** — The first 100 markets resolve via one-vote-per-eligible-node instead of stake-weighted resolution. Eligibility: identity age ≥ 3 days, not in predictor exclusion set, valid Argon2id PoW (Heavy-Node-only). Transitions to staked resolution at 1000 nodes.
* **Two-Tier State + Epoch Finality** — Tier 1 events propagate CRDT-style for low latency; Tier 2 events require epoch finality before they can be acted on. Identity rotation, progressive penalties, ramp milestones, and constitutional invariants enforced via `MappingProxyType`.
* **Adaptive Polling** — Sovereign Shell views poll every 8 seconds during active voting / challenge / activation phases, every 30–60 seconds when idle. Voting feels live without a websocket layer.
* **Verbatim Diagnostics** — Every write button surfaces the backend's verbatim rejection reason. No opaque "denied" toasts.

**Privacy primitive runway (NEW in v0.9.7):**

* **Function Keys — Anonymous Citizenship Proof** — A citizen proves "I am an Infonet citizen" without revealing their Infonet identity. 5 of 6 pieces shipped: nullifiers, challenge-response, two-phase commit receipts, enumerated denial codes, batched settlement. Issuance via blind signatures waits on a primitive decision (RSA blind sigs vs BBS+ vs U-Prove vs Idemix).
* **Locked Protocol Contracts** — Stable interfaces in `services/infonet/privacy/contracts.py` for ring signatures, stealth addresses, Pedersen commitments, range proofs, and DEX matching. The `privacy-core` Rust crate is the integration target — no caller of the privacy module needs to know which scheme is active.
* **Sprint 11+ Path** — When the cryptographic scheme is chosen, primitives wire into the locked Protocols without API churn.

> **Experimental Testnet — No Privacy Guarantee:** InfoNet messages are obfuscated but NOT end-to-end encrypted. The Mesh network (Meshtastic/APRS) is NOT private — radio transmissions are inherently public. The privacy primitive contracts are scaffolded but not yet wired. Do not send anything sensitive on any channel. Treat all channels as open and public for now.

### 🤖 Agentic AI Command Channel — OpenClaw + Compatible Agents (expanded in v0.9.7)

ShadowBroker exposes a **bidirectional agentic AI command channel** — a signed, tier-gated bridge that gives any compatible AI agent full read/write access to the intelligence platform. **OpenClaw is the reference agent**, but the channel is an open protocol: any LLM-driven agent that signs requests with HMAC-SHA256 (Claude Code, GPT, LangChain, custom Python/TypeScript clients, or your own integration) can connect as an analyst that sees the same data as the operator and can take actions on the map. ShadowBroker does *not* bundle an LLM, an agent runtime, or model weights — it provides the surface; you bring the agent.

v0.9.7 turns ShadowBroker from a dashboard a human watches into an intelligence surface any agent can act on.

**Channel transport (NEW in v0.9.7):**

* **Single Command Channel** — `POST /api/ai/channel/command` accepts `{cmd, args}` and dispatches to any registered tool.
* **Batched Concurrent Execution** — `POST /api/ai/channel/batch` accepts up to 20 commands in one request. The backend runs them concurrently and returns a fan-out result map. Cuts agent latency by an order of magnitude over sequential calls.
* **Tier-Gated Access** — `OPENCLAW_ACCESS_TIER` controls which commands the agent can call: `restricted` exposes the read-only set, `full` adds writes and injection. Discovery endpoint returns `available_commands` so the agent can introspect its own capabilities.
* **HMAC-SHA256 Signing** — Every command is signed `HMAC-SHA256(secret, METHOD|path|timestamp|nonce|sha256(body))` with timestamp + nonce replay protection and request integrity. Supports local mode (no config) and remote mode (agent on a different machine / VPS).

**Capabilities:**

* **Full Telemetry Access** — The agent queries all 35+ data layers: flights, ships, satellites, SIGINT, conflict events, earthquakes, fires, wastewater, prediction markets, and more. Fast and slow tier endpoints return enriched data with geographic coordinates, timestamps, and source attribution.
* **AI Intel Pins** — Place color-coded investigation markers directly on the operator's map. 14 pin categories (threat, anomaly, military, maritime, aviation, SIGINT, infrastructure, etc.) with confidence scores, TTL expiry, source URLs, and batch placement up to 100 pins at once.
* **Map Control** — Fly the operator's map view to any coordinate, trigger satellite imagery lookups, and open region dossiers. The agent can direct the operator's attention to specific locations in real time.
* **SAR Ground-Change** — Query SAR anomaly feeds, inspect pin details, manage AOIs, and fly the map to watch areas. The agent can monitor for ground deformation, flood extent, or damage and promote anomalies to pins.
* **Native Layer Injection** — Push custom data directly into ShadowBroker's native layers (CCTV cameras, ships, SIGINT nodes, military bases, etc.) so agent-discovered sources render alongside real feeds.
* **Wormhole Mesh Participation** — The agent can join the decentralized InfoNet, post signed messages, join encrypted gate channels, send/receive encrypted DMs, and interact with Meshtastic radio and Dead Drops — operating as a full mesh peer.
* **Sovereign Shell Participation (v0.9.7)** — File petitions, sign and vote on governance changes, stake on resolutions and disputes, signal Heavy-Node readiness for upgrades — all programmatically, all gated by tier and HMAC. Agents become first-class participants in the decentralized intelligence economy.
* **Geocoding & Proximity Scans** — Resolve place names to coordinates, then scan all layers within a radius for a complete proximity digest.
* **News & GDELT Near Location** — Pull GDELT conflict events and aggregated news articles near any coordinate for regional situational awareness.
* **Alert Delivery** — Send branded intelligence briefs, warnings, and threat notifications to Discord webhooks and Telegram channels.
* **Intelligence Reports** — Generate structured reports with summary stats, top military flights, correlations, earthquake activity, SIGINT counts, and pin inventories.
* **Auditable** — Every channel call is logged; the operator can introspect what the agent has done.

**Connect an agent:** Open the AI Intel panel in the left sidebar, click **Connect Agent**, and copy the HMAC secret. From there, point any compatible agent at the channel — for OpenClaw, import `ShadowBrokerClient` from the OpenClaw skill package; for any other agent, use the same HMAC contract documented above (timestamp + nonce + body digest, tier-gated). The channel is the protocol, not the agent.

### ⏱️ Time Machine — Snapshot Playback (NEW in v0.9.7)

A media-style transport for the entire telemetry feed. Treat the live map as a recording that can be scrubbed, paused, and replayed.

* **Live ↔ Snapshot Toggle** — Switching to snapshot mode pauses the global polling loop instantly; switching back to Live invalidates ETags and force-refreshes both fast and slow tiers so the dashboard catches up without a stale-frame flicker.
* **Hourly Index** — Every captured snapshot is indexed by its hour bucket with `count`, `latest_id`, `latest_ts`, and the full `snapshot_ids` list. Jump to any captured timestamp directly from the timeline scrubber.
* **Frame Interpolation** — Moving entities (aircraft, ships, satellites, military flights) interpolate smoothly between recorded frames during playback so motion stays continuous even when snapshots are sparse.
* **Variable Playback Speed** — Step, play, fast-forward, and rewind through saved telemetry at adjustable speed.
* **Profile-Aware** — Each snapshot records the privacy profile that was active when it was captured, so playback is faithful to what an operator on that profile would have seen.
* **Operator-Side, Not Server-Side** — Snapshots are stored locally in the backend; no third party ever sees the playback timeline.

### 📦 API Keys Panel — Path-First, Read-Only (NEW in v0.9.7)

Settings → API Keys is now a read-only registry. Key values never reach the browser process — not even an obfuscated prefix. The panel surfaces:

* The absolute path to the backend `.env` file as resolved by `Path(__file__).resolve()` — works on every OS, every drive, every install location (Linux `/home/...`, macOS `/Users/...`, Windows on any drive, Docker containers, cloud VMs).
* `[exists]` / `[will be created on first save]` / `[NOT WRITABLE — edit by hand]` indicators on the path itself.
* The path to the `.env.example` template so users can copy it and fill in their keys.
* A binary `CONFIGURED` / `NOT CONFIGURED` badge per key, plus a copy-pastable env line (e.g. `OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_VALUE`) the user can drop into the file by hand.

OpenSky API credentials are now a **critical-warn** environment requirement: the startup environment check flags missing OpenSky OAuth2 credentials with a strong warning, and the changelog modal links directly to the free registration page. Without them, the flights layer falls back to ADS-B-only coverage with significant gaps in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

## 🏗️ Architecture

ShadowBroker v0.9.7 is composed of three vertically-stacked planes — the **Operator UI**, the **Backend Service Plane**, and the **Decentralized Layer (InfoNet)** — plus two cross-cutting bridges (the **Time Machine** and the **Agentic AI Channel**, which is the protocol that OpenClaw and any other compatible agent connects through) and a **Privacy Core** Rust crate that backstops both the legacy mesh and the future shielded coin / DEX work.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🐳 Docker Setup (Recommended for Self-Hosting)

The repo includes a `docker-compose.yml` that pulls pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BigBodyCobain/Shadowbroker.git
cd Shadowbroker
# Add your API keys in a repo-root .env file (optional — see Environment Variables below)
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard.

> **Deploying publicly or on a LAN?** No configuration needed for most setups.
> The frontend proxies all API calls through the Next.js server to `BACKEND_URL`,
> which defaults to `http://backend:8000` (Docker internal networking).
> Host port `8000` is only published for local API/debug access. If it conflicts
> with another service, set `BACKEND_PORT=8001` in `.env`; leave `BACKEND_URL`
> as `http://backend:8000` because that is the Docker-internal port.
> The backend memory cap is controlled by `BACKEND_MEMORY_LIMIT` and defaults
> to `4G`. If Docker reports OOM events, the backend will restart and slow
> layers can look empty until they repopulate.
>
> If your backend runs on a **different host or port**, set `BACKEND_URL` at runtime — no rebuild required:
>
> ```bash
> # Linux / macOS
> BACKEND_URL=http://myserver.com:9096 docker compose up -d
>
> # Podman (via compose.sh wrapper)
> BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.1.50:9096 ./compose.sh up -d
>
> # Windows (PowerShell)
> $env:BACKEND_URL="http://myserver.com:9096"; docker compose up -d
>
> # Or add to a .env file next to docker-compose.yml:
> # BACKEND_URL=http://myserver.com:9096
> ```

**Podman users:** Do not pass the GitHub URL to `podman compose pull`; clone the repo first, `cd Shadowbroker`, then run compose from that folder. `podman compose` also requires a Compose provider. If Podman reports `looking up compose provider failed`, install one:

```bash
# Linux / macOS / WSL
python3 -m pip install --user podman-compose
podman-compose pull
podman-compose up -d
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
py -m pip install --user podman-compose
podman-compose pull
podman-compose up -d
```

If you are in a bash-compatible shell, the included wrapper can auto-detect Docker or Podman:

```bash
./compose.sh --engine podman pull
./compose.sh --engine podman up -d
```

---

### 🐋 Standalone Deploy (Portainer, Uncloud, NAS, etc.)

No need to clone the repo. Use the pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry. GitLab registry images may be used as a mirror if you publish them there.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following content and deploy it directly — paste it into Portainer's stack editor, `uncloud deploy`, or any Docker host:

```yaml
## Image registry — uncomment ONE line per service:
##   GitHub  (primary): ghcr.io/bigbodycobain/shadowbroker-backend:latest

> **How it works:** The frontend container proxies all `/api/*` requests through the Next.js server to `BACKEND_URL` using Docker's internal networking. The browser only ever talks to port 3000. The backend's host port is for local API/debug access and can be changed with `BACKEND_PORT=8001` without changing `BACKEND_URL`.
>
> `BACKEND_URL` is a plain runtime environment variable (not a build-time `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`), so you can change it in Portainer, Uncloud, or any compose editor without rebuilding the image. Set it to the address where your backend is reachable from inside the Docker network (e.g. `http://backend:8000`, `http://192.168.1.50:8000`).

### 📦 Quick Start (No Code Required)

If you just want to run the dashboard without dealing with terminal commands:

1. Go to the **[Releases](../../releases)** tab on the right side of this repo page.
2. Download the latest `.zip` file from the release.
3. Extract the folder to your computer.
4. **Windows:** Double-click `start.bat`.
   **Mac/Linux:** Open terminal, type `chmod +x start.sh`, `dos2unix start.sh`, and run `./start.sh`.
5. It will automatically install everything and launch the dashboard!

Local launcher notes:

- `start.bat` / `start.sh` run the app without Docker — they install dependencies and start both servers directly.
- If Wormhole identity or DM contact endpoints fail after an upgrade, check the `docs/mesh/` folder for troubleshooting.
- For DM root witness, transparency, and operator monitoring rollout, start with `docs/mesh/wormhole-dm-root-operations-runbook.md`.
- For sample DM root ops bridge assets, also see `scripts/mesh/poll-dm-root-health-alerts.mjs`, `scripts/mesh/export-dm-root-health-prometheus.mjs`, `scripts/mesh/publish-external-root-witness-package.mjs`, `scripts/mesh/smoke-external-root-witness-flow.mjs`, `scripts/mesh/smoke-root-transparency-publication-flow.mjs`, `scripts/mesh/smoke-dm-root-deployment-flow.mjs`, `scripts/mesh/sync-dm-root-external-assurance.mjs`, and `docs/mesh/examples/`.

### 💻 Developer Setup

If you want to modify the code or run from source:

#### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** 18+ and **npm** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Python** 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 with `pip` — [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (**check "Add to PATH"** during install)
  * ⚠️ Python 3.13+ may have compatibility issues with some dependencies. **3.11 or 3.12 is recommended.**
* API keys for: `aisstream.io` (required), and optionally `opensky-network.org` (OAuth2), `lta.gov.sg`

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BigBodyCobain/Shadowbroker.git
cd Shadowbroker

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install .

# Optional helper scripts (creates venv + installs dev deps)
# Windows PowerShell
# .\backend\scripts\setup-venv.ps1
# macOS/Linux
# ./backend/scripts/setup-venv.sh

# Optional env check (prints warnings for missing keys)
# Windows PowerShell
# .\backend\scripts\check-env.ps1
# macOS/Linux
# ./backend/scripts/check-env.sh

# Create .env with your API keys
echo "AIS_API_KEY=your_aisstream_key" >> .env
echo "OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=your_opensky_client_id" >> .env
echo "OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_opensky_secret" >> .env

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm ci
```

### Running

```bash
# From the frontend directory — starts both frontend & backend concurrently
npm run dev
```

This starts:

* **Next.js** frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
* **FastAPI** backend on `http://localhost:8000`

### Pre-commit (Optional)

If you use pre-commit, install hooks once from repo root:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Local AIS Receiver (Optional)

You can feed your own AIS ship data into ShadowBroker using an RTL-SDR dongle and [AIS-catcher](https://github.com/jvde-github/AIS-catcher), an open-source AIS decoder. This gives you real-time coverage of vessels in your local area — no API key needed.

1. Plug in an RTL-SDR dongle
2. Install AIS-catcher ([releases](https://github.com/jvde-github/AIS-catcher/releases)) or use the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --device /dev/bus/usb \
     ghcr.io/jvde-github/ais-catcher -H http://host.docker.internal:4000/api/ais/feed interval 10
   ```
3. Or run natively:
   ```bash
   AIS-catcher -H http://localhost:4000/api/ais/feed interval 10
   ```

AIS-catcher decodes VHF radio signals on 161.975 MHz and 162.025 MHz and POSTs decoded vessel data to ShadowBroker every 10 seconds. Ships detected by your SDR antenna appear alongside the global AIS stream.

**Docker (ARM/Raspberry Pi):** See [docker-shipfeeder](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-shipfeeder) for a production-ready Docker image optimized for ARM.

**Note:** AIS range depends on your antenna — typically 20-40 nautical miles with a basic setup, 60+ nm with a marine VHF antenna at elevation.

## 🔧 Performance

The platform is optimized for handling massive real-time datasets:

* **Gzip Compression** — API payloads compressed ~92% (11.6 MB → 915 KB)
* **ETag Caching** — `304 Not Modified` responses skip redundant JSON parsing
* **Viewport Culling** — Only features within the visible map bounds (+20% buffer) are rendered
* **Imperative Map Updates** — High-volume layers (flights, satellites, fires) bypass React reconciliation via direct `setData()` calls
* **Clustered Rendering** — Ships, CCTV, earthquakes, and data centers use MapLibre clustering to reduce feature count
* **Debounced Viewport Updates** — 300ms debounce prevents GeoJSON rebuild thrash during pan/zoom; 2s debounce on dense layers (satellites, fires)
* **Position Interpolation** — Smooth 10s tick animation between data refreshes
* **React.memo** — Heavy components wrapped to prevent unnecessary re-renders
* **Coordinate Precision** — Lat/lng rounded to 5 decimals (~1m) to reduce JSON size

## 🔑 Environment Variables

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```env
# Required for airplane telemetry (NEW in v0.9.7 — startup env check flags these as critical)
# Free registration: https://opensky-network.org/index.php?option=com_users&view=registration
OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=your_opensky_client_id      # OAuth2 — global flight state vectors
OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_opensky_secret     # OAuth2 — paired with Client ID above

# Optional (enhances data quality)
AIS_API_KEY=your_aisstream_key                # Maritime vessel tracking (aisstream.io) — ships layer empty without it
LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_lta_key                  # Singapore CCTV cameras
SHODAN_API_KEY=your_shodan_key                # Shodan device search overlay
SH_CLIENT_ID=your_sentinel_hub_id             # Copernicus CDSE Sentinel Hub imagery
SH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sentinel_hub_secret     # Paired with Sentinel Hub Client ID
MESH_SAR_EARTHDATA_USER=                      # NASA Earthdata user (SAR Mode B — OPERA products)
MESH_SAR_EARTHDATA_TOKEN=                     # NASA Earthdata token (paired with user above)
MESH_SAR_COPERNICUS_USER=                     # Copernicus Data Space user (SAR Mode B — EGMS / EMS)
MESH_SAR_COPERNICUS_TOKEN=                    # Copernicus token (paired with user above)
OPENCLAW_ACCESS_TIER=restricted               # OpenClaw agent tier: "restricted" (read-only) or "full"

# Private-lane privacy-core pinning (required when Arti or RNS is enabled)
PRIVACY_CORE_MIN_VERSION=0.1.0
PRIVACY_CORE_ALLOWED_SHA256=your_privacy_core_sha256
# Optional override if you load a non-default shared library path
PRIVACY_CORE_LIB=
```

When `MESH_ARTI_ENABLED=true` or `MESH_RNS_ENABLED=true`, backend startup now fails closed unless the loaded `privacy-core` artifact reports a parseable version at or above `PRIVACY_CORE_MIN_VERSION` and matches one of the hashes in `PRIVACY_CORE_ALLOWED_SHA256`.

Generate the hash from the artifact you intend to ship:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\privacy-core\target\release\privacy_core.dll -Algorithm SHA256
```

```bash
sha256sum ./privacy-core/target/release/libprivacy_core.so
```

Then confirm authenticated `GET /api/wormhole/status` or `GET /api/settings/wormhole-status` shows the same `privacy_core.version`, `privacy_core.library_path`, and `privacy_core.library_sha256`.

### Frontend

| Variable | Where to set | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BACKEND_URL` | `environment` in `docker-compose.yml`, or shell env | URL the Next.js server uses to proxy API calls to the backend. Defaults to `http://backend:8000`. **Runtime variable — no rebuild needed.** |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | repo-root `.env` or shell env before `docker compose up` | Host port used to expose the backend API for local diagnostics. Defaults to `8000`; set `BACKEND_PORT=8001` if port 8000 is already in use. Does not change Docker-internal `BACKEND_URL`. |

**How it works:** The frontend proxies all `/api/*` requests through the Next.js server to `BACKEND_URL` using Docker's internal networking. Browsers only talk to port 3000; the backend host port is only for local diagnostics. For local dev without Docker, `BACKEND_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:8000`.
