# Mini-SGLang

A **lightweight yet high-performance** inference framework for Large Language Models.

---

Mini-SGLang is a compact implementation of [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), designed to demystify the complexities of modern LLM serving systems. With a compact codebase of **~5,000 lines of Python**, it serves as both a capable inference engine and a transparent reference for researchers and developers.

## ✨ Key Features

- **High Performance**: Achieves state-of-the-art throughput and latency with advanced optimizations.
- **Lightweight & Readable**: A clean, modular, and fully type-annotated codebase that is easy to understand and modify.
- **Advanced Optimizations**:
  - **Radix Cache**: Reuses KV cache for shared prefixes across requests.
  - **Chunked Prefill**: Reduces peak memory usage for long-context serving.
  - **Overlap Scheduling**: Hides CPU scheduling overhead with GPU computation.
  - **Tensor Parallelism**: Scales inference across multiple GPUs.
  - **Optimized Kernels**: Integrates **FlashAttention** and **FlashInfer** for maximum efficiency.
  - ...

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

We recommend using `uv` for a fast and reliable installation (note that `uv` does not conflict with `conda`).

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (Python 3.10+ recommended)
uv venv --python=3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Prerequisites**: Mini-SGLang relies on CUDA kernels that are JIT-compiled. Ensure you have the **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit** installed and that its version matches your driver's version. You can check your driver's CUDA capability with `nvidia-smi`.

### 2. Installation

Install Mini-SGLang directly from the source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgl-project/mini-sglang.git
cd mini-sglang && uv venv --python=3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

### 3. Online Serving

Launch an OpenAI-compatible API server with a single command.

```bash
# Deploy Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B on a single GPU
python -m minisgl --model "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"

# Deploy meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct on 4 GPUs with Tensor Parallelism, on port 30000
python -m minisgl --model "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct" --tp 4 --port 30000
```

Once the server is running, you can send requests using standard tools like `curl` or any OpenAI-compatible client.

### 4. Interactive Shell

Chat with your model directly in the terminal by adding the `--shell` flag.

```bash
python -m minisgl --model "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B" --shell
```

You can also use `/reset` to clear the chat history.

## Benchmark

### Offline inference

See [bench.py](./benchmark/offline/bench.py) for more details. Set `MINISGL_DISABLE_OVERLAP_SCHEDULING=1` for ablation study on overlap scheduling.

Test Configuration:

- Hardware: 1xH200 GPU.
- Model: Qwen3-0.6B, Qwen3-14B
- Total Requests: 256 sequences
- Input Length: Randomly sampled between 100-1024 tokens
- Output Length: Randomly sampled between 100-1024 tokens

### Online inference

See [benchmark_qwen.py](./benchmark/online/bench_qwen.py) for more details.

Test Configuration:

- Hardware: 4xH200 GPU, connected by NVLink.
- Model: Qwen3-32B
- Dataset: [Qwen trace](https://github.com/alibaba-edu/qwen-bailian-usagetraces-anon/blob/main/qwen_traceA_blksz_16.jsonl), replaying first 1000 requests.

Launch command:

```bash
# Mini-SGLang
python -m minisgl --model "Qwen/Qwen3-32B" --tp 4 --cache naive

# SGLang
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model "Qwen/Qwen3-32B" --tp 4 \
    --disable-radix --port 1919 --decode-attention flashinfer
```
