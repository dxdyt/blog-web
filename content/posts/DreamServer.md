# Dream Server

### Own your AI. One person, one dream, one machine at a time.

A handful of companies control the vast majority of global AI traffic — and with it, your data, your costs, and your uptime. Every query you send to a centralized provider is business intelligence you don’t own, running on infrastructure you don’t control, priced on terms you can’t negotiate.

If AI is becoming critical infrastructure, it shouldn’t be rented. Self-hosting local AI should be a sovereign human right, not a career choice.

**Dream Server is the exit.** A local-first AI stack — LLM inference, chat, voice, agents, workflows, RAG, image generation, and privacy tools — deployed on your hardware with a single command. No cloud required. No subscriptions required. No one watching. Cloud and hybrid API modes are optional when you choose them.

## Why Dream Server?

Because running your own AI shouldn't require a CS degree and a weekend of debugging CUDA drivers. Right now, setting up local AI means stitching together a dozen projects, writing Docker configs from scratch, and praying everything talks to each other. Most people give up and go back to paying OpenAI.

We built Dream Server so you don't have to.

- **One command** — detects your GPU, picks the right model, generates credentials, launches everything
- **Chatting in under 2 minutes** — bootstrap mode gives you a working model instantly while your full model downloads in the background
- **Full service stack, pre-wired** — chat, agents, voice, workflows, search, RAG, image generation, privacy tools, observability, and developer tools. All talking to each other out of the box
- **Fully moddable** — every service is an extension. Drop in a folder, run `dream enable`, done

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer/main/dream-server/get-dream-server.sh | bash
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** and start chatting.

> **API endpoint:** Linux Docker installs expose llama-server on **http://localhost:11434** by default (`OLLAMA_PORT`) while containers use `llama-server:8080`. macOS native Metal and Windows native/Lemonade paths use **http://localhost:8080** unless overridden. Open WebUI stays on **http://localhost:3000**.

> **No GPU?** Dream Server also runs in cloud mode — same full stack, powered by OpenAI/Anthropic/Together APIs instead of local inference:
> ```bash
> ./install.sh --cloud
> ```

> **Port conflicts?** Every port is configurable via environment variables. See [`.env.example`](dream-server/.env.example) for the full list, or override at install time:
> ```bash
> WEBUI_PORT=9090 ./install.sh
> ```

![Dream Server Installer](resources/docs/images/installer-splash.gif)

*The DREAMGATE installer handles everything — GPU detection, model selection, service orchestration.*

</div>

<details>
<summary><b>Manual install (Linux)</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer/dream-server
./install.sh
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windows (PowerShell)</b></summary>

Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with WSL2 backend enabled.
**Install Docker Desktop first and make sure it is running before you start.**

Open a normal **PowerShell** session and run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
git clone https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer
.\install.ps1
```

> The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command allows the installer script to run in the current session. It does not change your system-wide policy.
> Running as Administrator is not recommended for the installer because user-level paths such as `.opencode`, `data/`, and `.env` can be created with admin-owned permissions.

The installer detects your GPU, picks the right model, generates credentials, starts all services, and creates a Desktop shortcut to the Dashboard. Manage with `.\dream-server\installers\windows\dream.ps1 status`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS (Apple Silicon)</b></summary>

Requires Apple Silicon (M1+) and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
**Install Docker Desktop first and make sure it is running before you start.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Light-Heart-Labs/DreamServer.git
cd DreamServer/dream-server
./install.sh
```

The installer detects your chip, picks the right model for your unified memory, launches llama-server natively with Metal acceleration, and starts all other services in Docker. Manage with `./dream-macos.sh status`.

See the [macOS Quickstart](dream-server/docs/MACOS-QUICKSTART.md) for details.

## Hardware Auto-Detection

The installer detects your GPU and picks the optimal model automatically. No manual configuration is required for the default path.

The current model map supports `MODEL_PROFILE=qwen` by default, plus `MODEL_PROFILE=gemma4` and `MODEL_PROFILE=auto` for Gemma 4 tiers where supported. Override tier selection with `./install.sh --tier 3`; override the model family with `MODEL_PROFILE=gemma4 ./install.sh` or `MODEL_PROFILE=auto ./install.sh`.

Override tier selection: `./install.sh --tier 3`

---

## Bootstrap Mode

No waiting for large downloads. Dream Server uses bootstrap mode by default:

1. Downloads a tiny 1.5B model in under a minute
2. You start chatting immediately
3. The full model downloads in the background
4. Hot-swap to the full model when it's ready — zero downtime

<div align="center">

![Installer downloading modules](resources/docs/images/installer-download.png)

*The installer pulls all services in parallel. Downloads are resume-capable — interrupted downloads pick up where they left off.*

</div>

Skip bootstrap: `./install.sh --no-bootstrap`

---

## Switching Models

The installer picks a model for your hardware, but you can switch anytime:

```bash
dream model current              # What's running now?
dream model list                 # Show all available tiers
dream model swap T3              # Switch to a different tier
```

If the new model isn't downloaded yet, pre-fetch it first:

```bash
./scripts/pre-download.sh --tier 3    # Download before switching
dream model swap T3                    # Then swap (restarts llama-server)
```

Already have a GGUF you want to use? Drop it in `data/models/`, update `GGUF_FILE` and `LLM_MODEL` in `.env`, and restart with the CLI:

```bash
dream restart llm
```

Or restart the container directly from the installed `dream-server` directory:

```bash
docker compose restart llama-server
```

Rollback is automatic — if a new model fails to load, Dream Server reverts to your previous model.

---

## Extensibility

Dream Server is designed to be modded. Every service is an extension — a folder with a `manifest.yaml` and a `compose.yaml`. The dashboard, CLI, health checks, and compose stack all discover extensions automatically.

```
extensions/services/
  my-service/
    manifest.yaml      # Metadata: name, port, health endpoint, GPU backends
    compose.yaml       # Docker Compose fragment (auto-merged into the stack)
```

```bash
dream enable my-service     # Enable it
dream disable my-service    # Disable it
dream list                  # See everything
```

The installer itself is modular — 6 libraries and 13 phases, each in its own file. Want to add a hardware tier, swap a default model, or skip a phase? Edit one file.

[Full extension guide](dream-server/docs/EXTENSIONS.md) | [Installer architecture](dream-server/docs/INSTALLER-ARCHITECTURE.md)

---

## dream-cli

The `dream` CLI manages your entire stack:

```bash
dream status                # Health checks + GPU status
dream list                  # All services and their state
dream logs llm              # Tail logs (aliases: llm, stt, tts)
dream restart [service]     # Restart one or all services
dream start / stop          # Start or stop the stack

dream mode cloud            # Switch to cloud APIs via LiteLLM
dream mode local            # Switch back to local inference
dream mode hybrid           # Local primary, cloud fallback

dream model swap T3         # Switch to a different hardware tier
dream enable n8n            # Enable an extension
dream disable whisper       # Disable one

dream config show           # View .env (secrets masked)
dream preset save gaming    # Snapshot current config
dream preset load gaming    # Restore it
```

## Wall of Heroes

Dream Server exists because people chose to build instead of wait. Every contributor here is part of something bigger than code — a growing resistance against the idea that AI should be rented, gated, and controlled by the few. These are the founders of the sovereign AI movement, proving that one person, one machine, and one dream is enough.

Thanks to [kyuz0](https://github.com/kyuz0) for [amd-strix-halo-toolboxes](https://github.com/kyuz0/amd-strix-halo-toolboxes) — pre-built ROCm containers for Strix Halo that saved us a lot of pain from having to build our own. And to [lhl](https://github.com/lhl) for [strix-halo-testing](https://github.com/lhl/strix-halo-testing) — the foundational Strix Halo AI research and rocWMMA performance work that the broader community builds on.

[Tony363 (Tony Siu)](https://github.com/Tony363) cares deeply about our mission, and has been a vital ally in helping us gain visibility and support in the world. His greatest contributions are as a person who believes in local AI and empowerment for the masses and who wants to see us succeed.

### Community Builds

### The Resistance

*   [Yasin Bursali (yasinBursali)](https://github.com/yasinBursali) — DreamServer's most prolific contributor across 80+ merged PRs spanning every layer of the stack. **Extensions portal**: built the full extensions lifecycle system — catalog generator with CI freshness validation, dream host agent for container management outside Docker (timing-safe auth, core service protection, per-service locking, setup hook execution), extensions API with 16-check compose security scanner (blocks privileged mode, docker socket mounts, dangerous capabilities, host namespaces, non-localhost port bindings) plus atomic installs with path traversal and symlink protection, Extensions dashboard page with install/enable/disable/uninstall, and comprehensive API/host agent/runtime lifecycle documentation. **Extensions library hardening**: led three waves of 50+ PRs standardizing all 33 extension manifests — security hardening (localhost binding, credential requirements, session isolation), setup hooks, image digest pinning, healthcheck fixes (IPv4 migration, tool availability, health_port for split endpoints), port conflict resolution, README standardization, platform compatibility matrix, feature ID deduplication, and compose security scan bypass closures for bare ports and security_opt normalization. **macOS portability**: fixed Apple Silicon Neural Engine detection, unified memory VRAM gating, GPU_BACKEND=apple alignment, BSD/GNU sed compatibility (`_sed_i`), portable timestamps (`_now_ms()`), Bash 4+ guards with Homebrew re-exec, readiness sidecar for native llama-server, LaunchAgent host agent integration, and WSL2 host RAM detection. **Dashboard API**: added tiered Privacy Shield auth, migrated privacy-shield toggle from Docker socket to host agent API, populated null status fields (disk/system/inference), fixed n8n health detection with shared aiohttp sessions, forced IPv4 in health checker for WSL2, added GPU service inference fallback from nvidia-smi processes, handled thinking model `<think>` blocks, and fixed version endpoint to read from .env. **Installer/CLI**: replaced deprecated n8n basic auth with v2.x admin setup, preserved .env inode during model swap (cat > instead of mv), preserved VERSION across /etc/os-release sourcing, fixed dream-cli symlink resolution, prevented double-inclusion of extension compose files, added load_env to stop/start/restart, disabled ComfyUI compose when image generation is off, fixed COMPOSE_FLAGS word-splitting, added reverse-dependency check to dream disable, and added SEARXNG_SECRET to CI fixtures. **Security**: hardened ComfyUI with loopback binding and no-new-privileges, secured OpenCode with auto-generated passwords, removed API key from token-spy HTML, added `set -euo pipefail` to the installer, and guarded nvidia-smi against [N/A] values on MIG/vGPU configurations. **Observability (April 2026)**: added per-container CPU/memory stats endpoint to the host agent with Docker stats parsing and IEC unit handling, added read-only service logs endpoint scoped to dream-server containers via Docker Compose project label filtering, routed dashboard log viewing through host agent with status code clamping (502 for upstream errors) and Docker Compose label spoofing prevention, added per-service resource metrics aggregation endpoint with parallel fetch and split-TTL caching, added real-time bootstrap download progress tracking with background file-size monitor and atomic JSON status writes, added macOS native llama-server hot-swap with old-model rollback on health-check failure and PID reuse verification. **CLI/Installer fixes**: fixed dream-cli version display to read from .env instead of hardcoded 2.0.0, added user-extensions directory scanning to service registry with built-in-first deduplication, replaced compose-flags cache deletion with proper regeneration via resolve-compose-stack, fixed GPU assignment JSON generation for single-GPU NVIDIA systems, added compose syntax validation before container launch in phase 11, added dream_min version bounds to 15 extension manifests, and pre-created privacy-shield data directory in the installer
*   [Youness Yachouti (y-coffee-dev)](https://github.com/y-coffee-dev) — Designed and built the full-stack multi-GPU system: NVIDIA topology detection via nvidia-smi topo matrix parsing, four-phase GPU assignment algorithm with topology-aware service placement, docker-compose.multigpu.yml overlay generation, and the dashboard GPU Monitor page with per-GPU cards, SVG sparkline charts, topology visualization, and service assignment views. Added five dream gpu CLI subcommands (status, topology, assignment, validate, reassign) with --auto/--manual/--dry-run modes and bash tab completions. Rewrote lib/safe-env.sh to split on first = only, fixing base64 value truncation in .env parsing. Added GPU environment passthrough to dashboard-api, SDXL download guard for disabled ComfyUI, and ANSI escape stripping for nvidia-smi output. Contributed 345 lines of GPU-specific tests. Tested on real multi-GPU hardware including 4x RTX 4060 Ti, 4x RTX 4080, and 8x RTX 5060 Ti configurations.
*   [Tony363 (Tony Siu)](https://github.com/Tony363) — Raised dashboard-api test coverage to 95% with 3,500+ lines of tests across 14 files including comprehensive endpoint coverage for setup, privacy, workflows, updates, agents, and GPU monitoring, plus 7 BATS shell test suites covering logging, constants, path-utils, bootstrap-model, nvidia-topo, ui, and background-tasks. Added comprehensive architecture overview documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md) with Mermaid diagrams for service topology, installer pipeline, and compose layering. Fixed the pre-existing ThemeProvider CI failure that was blocking every PR frontend check. Reported the PyYAML import crash on Manjaro/Arch (resolve-compose-stack.sh) with clear root cause analysis. Drives developer outreach and ecosystem growth as head of Coffee and Code Philadelphia. Earlier work: hardened service-registry.sh against shell injection, improved PII scrubber with Luhn check, fixed token-spy settings persistence with atomic writes, fixed SSH command injection in session-manager.sh, narrowed broad exception catches across dashboard-api, and authored CLAUDE.md with project instructions and design philosophy. Built three AI-powered GitHub Actions workflows: consolidated code review with fork detection and protected file enforcement, label-gated issue-to-PR automation with 4-job pipeline (validate/implement/guardrails/create-pr) and prompt injection hardening (anti-injection preamble, 4000-char truncation, tool restrictions, secret scanning), and nightly AI scanners for code review/docs/autonomous scanning with budget caps and manual-only triggers. Fixed unified APU name fallback in GPU detection for Strix Halo. Prototyped a full Rust/Axum rewrite of the dashboard-api with 285 tests, constant-time auth middleware, 3-crate workspace, and ~25MB Docker image (work-in-progress — extension security features being ported).
