# Knowledge Work Plugins

Plugins that turn Claude into a specialist for your role, team, and company. Built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), also compatible with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

## Why Plugins

Cowork lets you set the goal and Claude delivers finished, professional work. Plugins let you go further: tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose — so your team gets better and more consistent outcomes.

Each plugin bundles the skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents for a specific job function. Out of the box, they give Claude a strong starting point for helping anyone in that role. The real power comes when you customize them for your company — your tools, your terminology, your processes — so Claude works like it was built for your team.

## Plugin Marketplace

We're open-sourcing 11 plugins built and inspired by our own work:

## Getting Started

### Cowork

Install plugins from [claude.com/plugins](https://claude.com/plugins/).

### Claude Code

```bash
# Add the marketplace first
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins

# Then install a specific plugin
claude plugin install sales@knowledge-work-plugins
```

Once installed, plugins activate automatically. Skills fire when relevant, and slash commands are available in your session (e.g., `/sales:call-prep`, `/data:write-query`).

## How Plugins Work

Every plugin follows the same structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest
├── .mcp.json                    # Tool connections
├── commands/                    # Slash commands you invoke explicitly
└── skills/                      # Domain knowledge Claude draws on automatically
```

- **Skills** encode the domain expertise, best practices, and step-by-step workflows Claude needs to give you useful help. Claude draws on them automatically when relevant.
- **Commands** are explicit actions you trigger (e.g., `/finance:reconciliation`, `/product-management:write-spec`).
- **Connectors** wire Claude to the external tools your role depends on — CRMs, project trackers, data warehouses, design tools, and more — via [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Every component is file-based — markdown and JSON, no code, no infrastructure, no build steps.

## Making Them Yours

These plugins are generic starting points. They become much more useful when you customize them for how your company actually works:

- **Swap connectors** — Edit `.mcp.json` to point at your specific tool stack.
- **Add company context** — Drop your terminology, org structure, and processes into skill files so Claude understands your world.
- **Adjust workflows** — Modify skill instructions to match how your team actually does things, not how a textbook says to.
- **Build new plugins** — Use the `cowork-plugin-management` plugin or follow the structure above to create plugins for roles and workflows we haven't covered yet.

As your team builds and shares plugins, Claude becomes a cross-functional expert. The context you define gets baked into every relevant interaction, so leaders and admins can spend less time enforcing processes and more time improving them.

## Contributing

Plugins are just markdown files. Fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a PR.
