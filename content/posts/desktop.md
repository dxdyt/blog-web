## 🚀 Open Beta

Atuin Desktop is currently in **open beta**. We're actively collecting feedback and improving the experience based on real-world usage.

Read the [announcement post](https://blog.atuin.sh/atuin-desktop-open-source/)

## What is Atuin Desktop?

Most infrastructure is held together by five commands someone remembers when things go wrong. Documentation is out of date (if it exists at all), and the real answers are buried in Slack threads, rotting in Notion, or trapped in someone's shell history.

Atuin Desktop solves this by creating **executable runbooks** that bridge the gap between documentation and automation:

- **Kill context switching**: Chain shell commands, database queries, and HTTP requests in one place
- **Docs that don't rot**: Execute directly and stay relevant
- **Reusable automation**: Dynamic runbooks with Jinja-style templating  
- **Instant recall**: Autocomplete from your real shell history
- **Local-first, CRDT-powered**: If it runs in your terminal, it runs in a runbook
- **Sync and share**: Keep runbooks up to date across devices and teams with Atuin Hub

## Key Features

### 🔧 Embedded Execution
- Terminal blocks that run directly in the interface
- Database clients for live queries
- Prometheus charts and monitoring integration

### 📚 Living Documentation
- Runbooks that run
- No more copy-pasting from outdated docs
- Real workflows that teams can actually use

### 🔄 Dynamic Templating
- Jinja-style templating for reusable logic
- Variable substitution and conditional logic
- Parameterized workflows for different environments

### 🏛️ Local-First Architecture
- CRDT-powered collaboration
- Works offline, syncs when connected

## Use Cases

Teams are already using Atuin Desktop for:

- **Release Management**: Automated release checklists that actually run
- **Infrastructure Migration**: Safe, repeatable migration workflows
- **Environment Management**: Spinning up staging and production with confidence
- **Database Operations**: Collaborative live query management
- **Incident Response**: Runbooks for when things break
