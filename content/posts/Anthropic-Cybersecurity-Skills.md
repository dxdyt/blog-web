## Give any AI agent the security skills of a senior analyst

A junior analyst knows which Volatility3 plugin to run on a suspicious memory dump, which Sigma rules catch Kerberoasting, and how to scope a cloud breach across three providers. **Your AI agent doesn't — unless you give it these skills.**

This repo contains **817 structured cybersecurity skills** spanning **29 security domains**, each following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard.  Every skill is mapped to **six industry frameworks** — MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF 2.0, MITRE ATLAS, MITRE D3FEND, NIST AI RMF, and the MITRE Fight Fraud Framework (F3) — making this the only open-source skills library with unified cross-framework coverage.  Clone it, point your agent at it, and your next security investigation gets expert-level guidance in seconds.

## Six frameworks, one skill library

No other open-source skills library maps every skill to all of these frameworks.  One skill, six compliance checkboxes. 

| Framework | Version | Scope in this repo | What it maps |
|---|---|---|---|
| [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org) | v19.1 | 15 tactics · 286 techniques | Adversary behaviors and TTPs |
| [NIST CSF 2.0](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) | 2.0 | 6 functions · 22 categories | Organizational security posture |
| [MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org) | v5.4 | 16 tactics · 84 techniques | AI/ML adversarial threats |
| [MITRE D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org) | v1.3 | 7 categories · 267 techniques | Defensive countermeasures |
| [NIST AI RMF](https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF) | 1.0 | 4 functions · 72 subcategories | AI risk management |
| [MITRE F3 (Fight Fraud Framework)](https://ctid.mitre.org/fraud/) | v1.1 (2026-04-09) | 8 tactics · 123 techniques · 94 fraud-relevant skills | Cyber-enabled financial fraud TTPs |

**Example — a single skill maps across all six:**

| Skill | ATT&CK | NIST CSF | ATLAS | D3FEND | AI RMF | F3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `analyzing-network-traffic-of-malware` | T1071 | DE.CM | AML.T0047 | D3-NTA | MEASURE-2.6 | — |
| `detecting-business-email-compromise` | T1566 | DE.AE | — | — | — | F1005.006 · monetization |

### 🆕 MITRE Fight Fraud Framework (F3) — 94 fraud-relevant skills

[![MITRE F3](https://img.shields.io/badge/MITRE-F3_v1.1-blue?style=flat-square)](https://ctid.mitre.org/fraud/)

The **[MITRE Fight Fraud Framework (F3)](https://ctid.mitre.org/fraud/)** was released **April 9, 2026** by MITRE's Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID), co-developed with JPMorganChase, Citigroup, Lloyds Banking Group, Standard Chartered, CrowdStrike, Verizon Business, FS-ISAC, and others. It is an ATT&CK-compatible TTP catalog for **cyber-enabled financial fraud** — filling the gap ATT&CK leaves after initial compromise.

F3 v1.1 adds **two fraud-specific tactics** that ATT&CK does not enumerate:
- **Positioning** (`FA0001`) — actions taken after access to collect/manipulate data and prepare the fraud (synthetic-identity seeding, account warming, beneficiary setup, SIM-swap pre-positioning, banking-session hijack).
- **Monetization** (`FA0002`) — converting stolen assets into usable funds (money-mule layering, APP fraud, crypto off-ramping, card cash-out, refund/chargeback abuse).

Fraud-specific techniques use `F1XXX` IDs (e.g. `F1005.003` Add Beneficiary, `F1025.003` Wire Transfer, `F1007` Adversary-in-the-Browser); reused ATT&CK techniques keep their `T1XXX` IDs. Mappings live in each skill's `mitre_f3:` frontmatter block — all 123 F3 v1.1 technique IDs were verified against the upstream STIX bundle. See [`docs/mitre-f3-mapping.md`](docs/mitre-f3-mapping.md) for the schema.

### MITRE ATT&CK v19.1 — 754/754 skills mapped

Every skill carries a `mitre_attack` frontmatter list validated against **MITRE ATT&CK v19.1** (the latest release) using the official `mitreattack-python` library — 286 distinct techniques across all 15 Enterprise tactics, plus ICS and Mobile techniques where relevant. Zero revoked or deprecated IDs. v19.1's restructured Defense Evasion (now split into **Stealth** and **Defense Impairment**) is reflected below.

| Tactic | ID | Skills |
|--------|----|--------|
| Reconnaissance | TA0043 | 103 |
| Resource Development | TA0042 | 22 |
| Initial Access | TA0001 | 467 |
| Execution | TA0002 | 350 |
| Persistence | TA0003 | 444 |
| Privilege Escalation | TA0004 | 464 |
| Stealth | TA0005 | 442 |
| Defense Impairment | TA0112 | 92 |
| Credential Access | TA0006 | 202 |
| Discovery | TA0007 | 237 |
| Lateral Movement | TA0008 | 68 |
| Collection | TA0009 | 172 |
| Command and Control | TA0011 | 123 |
| Exfiltration | TA0010 | 82 |
| Impact | TA0040 | 50 |

## 🌍 GARS-2026 — Global Agentic AI Readiness Survey

I'm running a global academic study measuring how ready security professionals,
developers, and enterprise teams actually are for agentic AI — MCP servers,
tool calling, governance, and human-in-the-loop workflows.

**If you use this repo, your response would be a genuinely valuable data point.**

📋 **Take the survey (10 min):**
[Survey Link](https://mahipal.engineer/survey?utm_source=github_repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=gars2026)

- 60 questions · Anonymous · Supervised by SRH Berlin
- You get **50 Casky Tokens** for early access to [casky.ai](https://casky.ai)
- Results published open access under CC-BY 4.0

## 🚀 Try it on the Playground

Experience Casky.ai hands-on — no setup required.

**[→ Launch Playground on Casky.ai](https://casky.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=cohort_launch#waitlist)**

The playground lets you:
- Run live cybersecurity skill exercises against real targets
- See AI agents execute structured skills in real time
- Explore MITRE ATT&CK mapped workflows interactively
- Test threat hunting, DFIR, and penetration testing scenarios

No installation. No configuration. Just open and start.
## Why this exists

The cybersecurity workforce gap hit **4.8 million unfilled roles** globally in 2024 (ISC2). AI agents can help close that gap — but only if they have structured domain knowledge to work from. Today's agents can write code and search the web, but they lack the practitioner playbooks that turn a generic LLM into a capable security analyst.

Existing security tool repos give you wordlists, payloads, or exploit code. None of them give an AI agent the structured decision-making workflow a senior analyst follows: when to use each technique, what prerequisites to check, how to execute step-by-step, and how to verify results. That is the gap this project fills.

**Anthropic Cybersecurity Skills** is not a collection of scripts or checklists. It is an **AI-native knowledge base** built from the ground up for the agentskills.io standard  — YAML frontmatter for sub-second discovery, structured Markdown for step-by-step execution, and reference files for deep technical context.  Every skill encodes real practitioner workflows, not generated summaries.

## How AI agents use these skills

Each skill costs **~30 tokens to scan** (frontmatter only)  and **500–2,000 tokens to fully load** (complete workflow). This progressive disclosure architecture lets agents search all 817 skills in a single pass without blowing context windows. 

```
User prompt: "Analyze this memory dump for signs of credential theft"

Agent's internal process:

  1. Scans 817 skill frontmatters (~30 tokens each)
     → identifies 12 relevant skills by matching tags, description, domain

  2. Loads top 3 matches:
     • performing-memory-forensics-with-volatility3
     • hunting-for-credential-dumping-lsass
     • analyzing-windows-event-logs-for-credential-access

  3. Executes the structured Workflow section step-by-step
     → runs Volatility3 plugins, checks LSASS access patterns,
        correlates with event log evidence

  4. Validates results using the Verification section
     → confirms IOCs, maps findings to ATT&CK T1003 (Credential Dumping)
```

**Without these skills**, the agent guesses at tool commands and misses critical steps. **With them**, it follows the same playbook a senior DFIR analyst would use.

<summary><strong>📊 Framework deep dive — ATLAS, D3FEND, AI RMF</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

### MITRE ATLAS v5.4 — AI/ML adversarial threats
ATLAS maps adversarial tactics, techniques, and case studies specific to AI and machine learning systems. Version 5.4 covers **16 tactics and 84 techniques** including agentic AI attack vectors added in late 2025: AI agent context poisoning, tool invocation abuse, MCP server compromises, and malicious agent deployment.  Skills mapped to ATLAS help agents identify and defend against threats to ML pipelines, model weights, inference APIs, and autonomous workflows. 

### MITRE D3FEND v1.3 — Defensive countermeasures
D3FEND is an NSA-funded knowledge graph of **267 defensive techniques** organized across 7 tactical categories: Model, Harden, Detect, Isolate, Deceive, Evict, and Restore.  Built on OWL 2 ontology, it uses a shared Digital Artifact layer to bidirectionally map defensive countermeasures to ATT&CK offensive techniques.  Skills tagged with D3FEND identifiers let agents recommend specific countermeasures for detected threats.

### NIST AI RMF 1.0 + GenAI Profile (AI 600-1)
The AI Risk Management Framework defines 4 core functions — Govern, Map, Measure, Manage — with **72 subcategories** for trustworthy AI development.  The GenAI Profile (AI 600-1, July 2024) adds **12 risk categories** specific to generative AI, from confabulation and data privacy to prompt injection and supply chain risks.  Colorado's AI Act (effective February 2026) provides a **legal safe harbor** for organizations complying with NIST AI RMF, making these mappings directly relevant to regulatory compliance.
