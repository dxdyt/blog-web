# What is OpenHuman?

OpenHuman is an open-source agentic assistant designed to integrate with you in your daily life. Each bullet links to the deeper writeup in the [docs](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/).

- **Simple, UI-first & Human** A clean desktop experience and short onboarding paths take you from install to a working agent in a few clicks — no config-first setup, no terminal required. The agent has [a face](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/mascot): a desktop mascot that speaks, reacts to its surroundings, [joins your Google Meets](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/mascot/meeting-agents) as a real participant, remembers you across weeks, and keeps thinking in the background even when you've stopped typing.

- **[118+ third-party integrations](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/integrations) with [auto-fetch](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/obsidian-wiki/auto-fetch)**: plug into Gmail, Notion, GitHub, Slack, Stripe, Calendar, Drive, Linear, Jira and the rest of your stack with **one-click OAuth**. Every connection is exposed to the agent as a typed tool, and every twenty minutes the core walks each active connection and pulls fresh data into the [memory tree](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/integrations/auto-fetch). No prompts, no polling loops you have to write, so the agent already has tomorrow's context this morning.

- **[Memory Tree](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/memory-tree) + [Obsidian Wiki](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/obsidian-wiki)**: a local-first knowledge base built from your data and your activity. Everything you connect is canonicalized into ≤3k-token Markdown chunks, scored, and folded into hierarchical summary trees stored in **SQLite on your machine**. The same chunks land as `.md` files in an Obsidian-compatible vault you can open, browse and edit, inspired by Karpathy's [obsidian-wiki workflow](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2039805659525644595).

- **Batteries included**: web search, a web-fetch [scraper](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/native-tools), a full coder toolset (filesystem, git, lint, test, grep), and [native voice](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/voice) (STT in, ElevenLabs TTS out, mascot lip-sync, live Google Meet agent) are wired in by default. [Model routing](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/model-routing) sends each task to the right LLM (reasoning, fast, or vision) under one subscription. No "install a plugin to read files" friction. [Optional local AI via Ollama](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/model-routing/local-ai) for on-device workloads.

- **[Smart token compression (TokenJuice)](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/token-compression)**: every tool call, scrape result, email body, and search payload is run through a token compression layer before it touches any LLM Model. HTML is converted to Markdown, long URLs are shortened, and verbose tool output is deduped and summarized via a configurable rule overlay etc... CJK, emoji, and other multi-byte text are preserved grapheme-by-grapheme — never stripped. You get the same information but at a fraction of the tokens. Reducing cost &amp; latency by up to 80%.

- **[Messaging channels](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/integrations#messaging-channels)** and **[privacy & security](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/privacy-and-security)**: inbound/outbound across the channels you already use, with workflow data that stays on device, encrypted locally, treated as yours.

## Contributing from source

New contributor? Start with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the fork/PR workflow and local validation commands, or use the copy-paste AI-agent prompt in [`CONTRIBUTING-BEGINNERS.md`](./CONTRIBUTING-BEGINNERS.md#optional-let-an-ai-coding-agent-guide-you). The short path is:

1. Install Git, Node.js 24+, pnpm 10.10.0, Rust 1.93.0 (`rustfmt` + `clippy`), CMake, Ninja, ripgrep, and the platform desktop build prerequisites.
2. Fork and clone the repo, then run `git submodule update --init --recursive` before `pnpm install` so the vendored Tauri/CEF sources are present.
3. Use `pnpm dev` for web-only UI work, `pnpm --filter openhuman-app dev:app` for the desktop shell, and focused checks such as `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm format:check`, and `cargo check -p openhuman --lib` before opening a PR.

## Context in minutes, not weeks

OpenHuman is the first agent harness that gets to know you in minutes. Inspired by [Karpathy's LLM Knowledgebase](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2039805659525644595). Most agents start cold. Hermes learns by watching you work; OpenClaw waits for plugins to ferry context in. Either way, you spend days or weeks before the agent knows enough about your stack to be genuinely useful.

</p>

> OpenHuman summarizes and compresses all your documents, emails & chats; and creates a memory graph that lets your agent remember everything about you.

OpenHuman skips the wait. Connect your accounts, let [auto-fetch](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/integrations/auto-fetch) pull data locally on a 20-minute loop, and then have [Memory Trees](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/memory-tree) compress everything into Markdown files stored intelligently in a [Karpathy-style Obsidian wiki](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/obsidian-wiki).

In just one sync pass, the agent has full (compressed) context of your inbox, your calendar, your repos, your docs, your messages. No training period. No "give it a few weeks.". It becomes you, controlled by you.

Already self-host [agentmemory](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory) across other coding agents? OpenHuman ships an optional `Memory` backend that proxies to it — set `memory.backend = "agentmemory"` in `config.toml` and the same durable store powers OpenHuman alongside Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode. See the [agentmemory backend](https://tinyhumans.gitbook.io/openhuman/features/obsidian-wiki/agentmemory-backend) page for setup.

## OpenHuman vs Other Agent Harnesses

High-level comparison (products evolve, so verify against each vendor). OpenHuman is built to **minimize vendor sprawl**, keep **workflow knowledge on-device**, and give the agent a **persistent memory** of your data, not only chat.
