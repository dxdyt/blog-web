## About UltraRAG

<a href="https://trendshift.io/repositories/18747" target="_blank"><img src="https://trendshift.io/api/badge/repositories/18747" alt="OpenBMB%2FUltraRAG | Trendshift" style="width: 250px; height: 55px;" width="250" height="55"/></a>

UltraRAG is the first lightweight RAG development framework based on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) architecture design, jointly launched by [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, [NEUIR](https://neuir.github.io) at Northeastern University, [OpenBMB](https://www.openbmb.cn/home), and [AI9stars](https://github.com/AI9Stars).

Designed for research exploration and industrial prototyping, UltraRAG standardizes core RAG components (Retriever, Generation, etc.) as independent **MCP Servers**, combined with the powerful workflow orchestration capabilities of the **MCP Client**. Developers can achieve precise orchestration of complex control structures such as conditional branches and loops simply through YAML configuration.

### UltraRAG UI

UltraRAG UI transcends the boundaries of traditional chat interfaces, evolving into a visual RAG Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that combines orchestration, debugging, and demonstration.

The system features a powerful built-in Pipeline Builder that supports bidirectional real-time synchronization between "Canvas Construction" and "Code Editing," allowing for granular online adjustments of pipeline parameters and prompts. Furthermore, it introduces an Intelligent AI Assistant to empower the entire development lifecycle, from pipeline structural design to parameter tuning and prompt generation. Once constructed, logic flows can be converted into interactive dialogue systems with a single click. The system seamlessly integrates Knowledge Base Management components, enabling users to build custom knowledge bases for document Q&A. This truly realizes a one-stop closed loop, spanning from underlying logic construction and data governance to final application deployment.

### Key Highlights

- 🚀 **Low-Code Orchestration of Complex Workflows**  
  - **Inference Orchestration**: Natively supports control structures such as sequential, loop, and conditional branches. Developers only need to write YAML configuration files to implement complex iterative RAG logic in dozens of lines of code.

- ⚡ **Modular Extension and Reproduction**
	- **Atomic Servers**: Based on the MCP architecture, functions are decoupled into independent Servers. New features only need to be registered as function-level Tools to seamlessly integrate into workflows, achieving extremely high reusability.

- 📊 **Unified Evaluation and Benchmark Comparison**  
  - **Research Efficiency**: Built-in standardized evaluation workflows, ready-to-use mainstream research benchmarks. Through unified metric management and baseline integration, significantly improves experiment reproducibility and comparison efficiency.  
	
- ✨ **Rapid Interactive Prototype Generation**  
  - **One-Click Delivery**: Say goodbye to tedious UI development. With just one command, Pipeline logic can be instantly converted into an interactive conversational Web UI, shortening the distance from algorithm to demonstration.  


## Installation

We provide two installation methods: local source code installation (recommended using `uv` for package management) and Docker container deployment

### Method 1: Source Code Installation

We strongly recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage Python environments and dependencies, as it can greatly improve installation speed.

**Prepare Environment**

If you haven't installed uv yet, please execute:

```shell
## Direct installation
pip install uv
## Download
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Download Source Code**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraRAG.git --depth 1
cd UltraRAG
```

**Install Dependencies**

Choose one of the following modes to install dependencies based on your use case:

**A: Create a New Environment** Use `uv sync` to automatically create a virtual environment and synchronize dependencies:

- Core dependencies: If you only need to run basic core functions, such as only using UltraRAG UI:
  ```shell
  uv sync
  ```

- Full installation: If you want to fully experience UltraRAG's retrieval, generation, corpus processing, and evaluation functions, please run:
  ```shell
  uv sync --all-extras
  ```
- On-demand installation: If you only need to run specific modules, keep the corresponding `--extra` as needed, for example:

  ```shell
  uv sync --extra retriever   # Retrieval module only
  uv sync --extra generation  # Generation module only
  ```

Once installed, activate the virtual environment:

```shell
# Windows CMD
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows Powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**B: Install into an Existing Environment** To install UltraRAG into your currently active Python environment, use `uv pip`:

```shell
# Core dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Full installation
uv pip install -e ".[all]"

# On-demand installation
uv pip install -e ".[retriever]"
```

### Method 2: Docker Container Deployment

If you prefer not to configure a local Python environment, you can deploy using Docker.

**Get Code and Images**

```shell
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/UltraRAG.git --depth 1
cd UltraRAG

# 2. Prepare the image (choose one)
# Option A: Pull from Docker Hub
docker pull hdxin2002/ultrarag:v0.3.0-base-cpu # Base version (CPU)
docker pull hdxin2002/ultrarag:v0.3.0-base-gpu # Base version (GPU)
docker pull hdxin2002/ultrarag:v0.3.0          # Full version (GPU)

# Option B: Build locally
docker build -t ultrarag:v0.3.0 .

# 3. Start container (port 5050 is automatically mapped)
docker run -it --gpus all -p 5050:5050 <docker_image_name>
```

**Start the Container**

```shell
# Start the container (Port 5050 is mapped by default)
docker run -it --gpus all -p 5050:5050 <docker_image_name>
```

Note: After the container starts, UltraRAG UI will run automatically. You can directly access `http://localhost:5050` in your browser to use it.

### Verify Installation

After installation, run the following example command to check if the environment is normal:

```shell
ultrarag run examples/sayhello.yaml
```

If you see the following output, the installation is successful:

```
Hello, UltraRAG v3!
```
