VoiceInk is a native macOS application that transcribes what you say to text almost instantly. You can find all the information and download the app from [here](https://tryvoiceink.com). 

![VoiceInk Mac App](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12367379-83e7-48a6-b52c-4488a6a04bba)

After dedicating the past 5 months to developing this app, I've decided to open source it for the greater good. 

My goal is to make it **the most efficient and privacy-focused voice-to-text solution for macOS** that is a joy to use. While the source code is now open for experienced developers to build and contribute, purchasing a license helps support continued development and gives you access to automatic updates, priority support, and upcoming features.

## Features

- 🎙️ **Accurate Transcription**: Local AI models that transcribe your voice to text with 99% accuracy, almost instantly
- 🔒 **Privacy First**: 100% offline processing ensures your data never leaves your device
- ⚡ **Power Mode**: Intelligent app detection automatically applies your perfect pre-configured settings based on the app/ URL you're on
- 🧠 **Context Aware**: Smart AI that understands your screen content and adapts to the context
- 🎯 **Global Shortcuts**: Configurable keyboard shortcuts for quick recording and push-to-talk functionality
- 📝 **Personal Dictionary**: Train the AI to understand your unique terminology with custom words, industry terms, and smart text replacements
- 🔄 **Smart Modes**: Instantly switch between AI-powered modes optimized for different writing styles and contexts
- 🤖 **AI Assistant**: Built-in voice assistant mode for a quick chatGPT like conversational assistant
