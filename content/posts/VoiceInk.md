VoiceInk is a native macOS application that transcribes what you say to text almost instantly. You can find all the information and download the app from [here](https://tryvoiceink.com). 

![VoiceInk Mac App](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12367379-83e7-48a6-b52c-4488a6a04bba)

After dedicating the past 5 months to developing this app, I've decided to open source it for the greater good. 

My goal is to make it **the most efficient and privacy-focused voice-to-text solution for macOS** that is a joy to use. While the source code is now open for experienced developers to build and contribute, purchasing a license helps support continued development and gives you access to automatic updates, priority support, and upcoming features.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Accurate Transcription**: Local AI models that transcribe your voice to text with 99% accuracy, almost instantly
- üîí **Privacy First**: 100% offline processing ensures your data never leaves your device
- ‚ö° **Power Mode**: Intelligent app detection automatically applies your perfect pre-configured settings based on the app/ URL you're on
- üß† **Context Aware**: Smart AI that understands your screen content and adapts to the context
- üéØ **Global Shortcuts**: Configurable keyboard shortcuts for quick recording and push-to-talk functionality
- üìù **Personal Dictionary**: Train the AI to understand your unique terminology with custom words, industry terms, and smart text replacements
- üîÑ **Smart Modes**: Instantly switch between AI-powered modes optimized for different writing styles and contexts
- ü§ñ **AI Assistant**: Built-in voice assistant mode for a quick chatGPT like conversational assistant
