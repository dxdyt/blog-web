**Supertonic** is a lightning-fast, on-device multilingual text-to-speech system designed for local inference with minimal overhead. Powered by ONNX Runtime, it runs entirely on your device—no cloud, no API calls, no privacy concerns.

### ✨ Highlights

- ⚡ **Blazingly Fast** — Low-latency, real-time synthesis across desktop, browser, mobile, and edge — fast enough to turn an entire webpage into audio in under a second
- 🌍 **31-Language Multilingual** — Synthesize directly from text across 31 languages, or pass `lang="na"` to let Supertonic process the text language-agnostically when you don't know the input language — no separate language adapters needed
- 🪶 **99M-Parameter Open-Weight Model** — A compact, fully open-weight checkpoint — a fraction of the size of 0.7B–2B class open TTS systems — for smaller downloads, faster cold starts, and lower memory footprint
- 📱 **Edge-Device Ready** — Runs locally on desktop, mobile, browsers, and resource-constrained hardware like Raspberry Pi or e-readers, with zero network dependency, complete privacy, and no GPU required
- 🔊 **44.1kHz High-Quality Audio** — Outputs studio-grade 44.1kHz 16-bit WAV directly, ready for production playback without any external upsampler
- 🎭 **Expression Tags** — 10 inline tags (e.g. `<laugh>`, `<breath>`, `<sigh>`) bring natural human nuance into generated speech without prompt engineering or reference audio
- 🛠️ **Multi-Runtime SDKs** — Ready-to-use examples through ONNX Runtime across Python, Node.js, Browser (WebGPU), Java, C++, C#, Go, Swift, iOS, Rust, and Flutter

### 🌍 Supported Languages (31)

Arabic (`ar`), Bulgarian (`bg`), Croatian (`hr`), Czech (`cs`), Danish (`da`), Dutch (`nl`), English (`en`), Estonian (`et`), Finnish (`fi`), French (`fr`), German (`de`), Greek (`el`), Hindi (`hi`), Hungarian (`hu`), Indonesian (`id`), Italian (`it`), Japanese (`ja`), Korean (`ko`), Latvian (`lv`), Lithuanian (`lt`), Polish (`pl`), Portuguese (`pt`), Romanian (`ro`), Russian (`ru`), Slovak (`sk`), Slovenian (`sl`), Spanish (`es`), Swedish (`sv`), Turkish (`tr`), Ukrainian (`uk`), Vietnamese (`vi`)

> **Not sure which language your text is in?** Pass `lang="na"` and Supertonic will handle the input in a language-agnostic way — no explicit language tag required.

---

## Quick Start

Install the Python SDK and generate speech immediately. On the first run, Supertonic downloads the model assets from Hugging Face automatically.

```bash
pip install supertonic
```

### Python

```python
from supertonic import TTS

# First run downloads the model from Hugging Face automatically.
tts = TTS(auto_download=True)

style = tts.get_voice_style(voice_name="M1")

text = "Supertonic is a lightning fast, on-device TTS system."

wav, duration = tts.synthesize(
    text=text,
    lang="en",                      # Language code (e.g., "en", "ko", "na" for language-agnostic)
    voice_style=style,              # Voice style object
    total_steps=8,                  # Quality: 5 (low) to 12 (high), default 8 (medium)
    speed=1.05,                     # Speed: 0.7 (slow) to 2.0 (fast)
)
# wav: numpy array of shape (1, num_samples,) with dtype=np.float32, sampled at 44100 Hz
# duration: numpy array of shape (1,) containing the duration of the generated audio in seconds

tts.save_audio(wav, "output.wav")
# import soundfile as sf
# sf.write("output.wav", wav.squeeze(), 44100)

print(f"Generated {duration[0]:.2f}s of audio")
```

### Local HTTP Server

The Python SDK can also run Supertonic as a local HTTP service. This is useful when you want to call Supertonic from tools that already speak HTTP, such as local agents, browser extensions, Electron apps, workflow automation tools, or OpenAI-compatible audio clients.

```bash
pip install 'supertonic[serve]'
supertonic serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7788
```

Once running, use the native `POST /v1/tts` endpoint or the OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/speech` endpoint. The server also exposes interactive OpenAPI docs at `http://127.0.0.1:7788/docs`. See the [supertonic-py serve guide](https://supertone-inc.github.io/supertonic-py/cli/serve/) for request examples, batch synthesis, and custom Voice Builder JSON import.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supertone-inc/supertonic.git
cd supertonic
```

### Prerequisites

Before running the examples, download the ONNX models and preset voices, and place them in the `assets` directory:

> **Note:** The Hugging Face repository uses Git LFS. Please ensure Git LFS is installed and initialized before cloning or pulling large model files.
> - macOS: `brew install git-lfs && git lfs install`
> - Generic: see `https://git-lfs.com` for installers

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/Supertone/supertonic-3 assets
```

Some language examples need native runtimes:
- **Go**: install the ONNX Runtime C library. On macOS, `brew install onnxruntime` is enough; the Go example auto-detects Homebrew paths.
- **Java**: use a JDK, not just a JRE. On macOS, `brew install openjdk@17` works.
- **C#**: targets .NET 9 and allows major-version roll-forward, so .NET 9 or newer runtimes can run it.

Then run the Python example:

```bash
cd py
uv sync
uv run example_onnx.py
```

This generates `outputs/output.wav` using the default preset voice.

## Performance Highlights

Supertonic 3 is designed for practical on-device inference: compact enough to run locally, while staying competitive with much larger open TTS systems.

### Reading Accuracy

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/metrics/s3_vs_measured_wer_range_voxcpm2.png" alt="Supertonic 3 reading accuracy compared with measured model ranges and VoxCPM2">
</p>

Evaluated on the **[Minimax-MLS-test](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MiniMaxAI/TTS-MLS-Test) benchmark**, Supertonic 3 stays within a competitive WER/CER range against much larger open TTS models such as VoxCPM2, while preserving a lightweight on-device deployment path. Asterisked languages (`*`) use CER; the others use WER.

### Supertonic 2 to Supertonic 3

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/metrics/supertonic2_vs_3_comparison.png" alt="Supertonic 2 and Supertonic 3 comparison">
</p>

Compared with Supertonic 2, Supertonic 3 reduces repeat and skip failures, improves speaker similarity across the shared-language set, and expands language coverage from 5 to 31 languages. It keeps the v2-compatible public ONNX interface, so existing integrations can move to v3 with the same inference contract.

### Runtime Footprint

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/metrics/runtime_cpu_gpu_latency_memory.png" alt="Supertonic CPU runtime compared with GPU baselines">
</p>

Supertonic 3 runs fast on CPU, even compared with larger baselines measured on A100 GPU, and uses substantially less memory. The open-weight fixed-voice setting does not require a GPU, which makes local, browser, and edge deployment much easier.

### Model Size

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/metrics/model_size_comparison.png" alt="Model size comparison">
</p>

At about 99M parameters across the public ONNX assets, Supertonic 3 is much smaller than 0.7B to 2B class open TTS systems. The smaller model size is a practical advantage for download size, startup time, and on-device inference.

## Voice Cloning

This open-weight repository focuses on fixed-voice, local TTS and does not include an official voice-cloning pipeline. If you want to bring your own voice to local Supertonic deployment, [Voice Builder](https://supertonic.supertone.ai/voice-builder) turns a short reference recording into version-specific JSON files for Supertonic 2 and Supertonic 3, so the same custom voice can move with you across supported Supertonic versions.

For a managed creation workflow, [Supertone Play](https://play.supertone.ai/) and the [Supertone API](https://www.supertone.ai/ko/api) provide hosted TTS and voice services with 700+ commercially usable preset voices. You can also listen to Supertonic 3 zero-shot samples on the [official showcase](https://supertonic3.github.io/).

The following papers describe the core technologies used in Supertonic. If you use this system in your research or find these techniques useful, please consider citing the relevant papers:

### SupertonicTTS: Main Architecture

This paper introduces the overall architecture of SupertonicTTS, including the speech autoencoder, flow-matching based text-to-latent module, and efficient design choices.
