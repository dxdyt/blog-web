- **2025.11.24** - Added Flutter SDK support with macOS compatibility

## Quick Start

Install the Python SDK and generate speech immediately. On the first run, Supertonic downloads the model assets from Hugging Face automatically.

```bash
pip install supertonic
```

### Python

```python
from supertonic import TTS

# First run downloads the model from Hugging Face automatically.
tts = TTS(auto_download=True)

style = tts.get_voice_style(voice_name="M1")

text = "A gentle breeze moved through the open window while everyone listened to the story."
wav, duration = tts.synthesize(text, voice_style=style, lang="en")

tts.save_audio(wav, "output.wav")
print(f"Generated {duration:.2f}s of audio")
```

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supertone-inc/supertonic.git
cd supertonic
```

### Prerequisites

Before running the examples, download the ONNX models and preset voices, and place them in the `assets` directory:

> **Note:** The Hugging Face repository uses Git LFS. Please ensure Git LFS is installed and initialized before cloning or pulling large model files.
> - macOS: `brew install git-lfs && git lfs install`
> - Generic: see `https://git-lfs.com` for installers

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/Supertone/supertonic-3 assets
```

Some language examples need native runtimes:
- **Go**: install the ONNX Runtime C library. On macOS, `brew install onnxruntime` is enough; the Go example auto-detects Homebrew paths.
- **Java**: use a JDK, not just a JRE. On macOS, `brew install openjdk@17` works.
- **C#**: targets .NET 9 and allows major-version roll-forward, so .NET 9 or newer runtimes can run it.

Then run the Python example:

```bash
cd py
uv sync
uv run example_onnx.py
```

This generates `outputs/output.wav` using the default preset voice.

## Performance Highlights

Supertonic 3 is designed for practical on-device inference: compact enough to run locally, while staying competitive with much larger open TTS systems.

### Reading Accuracy

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/metrics/s3_vs_measured_wer_range_voxcpm2.png" alt="Supertonic 3 reading accuracy compared with measured model ranges and VoxCPM2">
</p>

Across measured languages, Supertonic 3 stays within a competitive WER/CER range against much larger open TTS models such as VoxCPM2, while preserving a lightweight on-device deployment path. Asterisked languages use CER; the others use WER.

### Supertonic 2 to Supertonic 3

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/metrics/supertonic2_vs_3_comparison.png" alt="Supertonic 2 and Supertonic 3 comparison">
</p>

Compared with Supertonic 2, Supertonic 3 reduces repeat and skip failures, improves speaker similarity across the shared-language set, and expands language coverage from 5 to 31 languages. It keeps the v2-compatible public ONNX interface, so existing integrations can move to v3 with the same inference contract.

### Runtime Footprint

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/metrics/runtime_cpu_gpu_latency_memory.png" alt="Supertonic CPU runtime compared with GPU baselines">
</p>

Supertonic 3 runs fast on CPU, even compared with larger baselines measured on A100 GPU, and uses substantially less memory. The open-weight fixed-voice setting does not require a GPU, which makes local, browser, and edge deployment much easier.

### Model Size

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/metrics/model_size_comparison.png" alt="Model size comparison">
</p>

At about 99M parameters across the public ONNX assets, Supertonic 3 is much smaller than 0.7B to 2B class open TTS systems. The smaller model size is a practical advantage for download size, startup time, and on-device inference.
