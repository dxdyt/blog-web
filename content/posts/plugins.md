# Cursor plugins

Official Cursor plugins for popular developer tools, frameworks, and SaaS products. Each plugin is a standalone directory at the repository root with its own `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest.

## Plugins

| `name` | Plugin | Author | Category | `description` (from marketplace) |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|:---------|:-------------------------------------|

| `cursor-team-kit` | [Cursor Team Kit](cursor-team-kit/) | Cursor | Developer Tools | Internal team workflows used by Cursor developers for CI, code review, shipping, local automation, and verification. |
| `thermos` | [Thermos](thermos/) | Cursor | Developer Tools | Thermo-nuclear branch review: deep security/correctness audits, harsh code-quality rubrics, parallel subagents, thermos orchestration, and optional merge-ready PR flows. |
| `create-plugin` | [Create Plugin](create-plugin/) | Cursor | Developer Tools | Scaffold and validate new Cursor plugins. |

| `docs-canvas` | [Docs Canvas](docs-canvas/) | Cursor | Developer Tools | Render documentation — architecture notes, API references, runbooks, and codebase walkthroughs — as a navigable Cursor Canvas with sections, table of contents, diagrams, and cross-references. |
| `cursor-sdk` | [Cursor SDK](cursor-sdk/) | Cursor | Developer Tools | Build apps, scripts, CI pipelines, and automations on top of the Cursor TypeScript SDK (@cursor/sdk) — runtime selection, auth, streaming, MCP, error handling, and ready-to-extend integration patterns. |

| `pstack` | [pstack](pstack/) | Lauren Tan | Developer Tools | if you want to go fast, go deep first. pstack helps you write less, but higher quality code. rigorous agent workflows you can parallelize with confidence. |

Author values match each plugin’s `plugin.json` `author.name` (Cursor lists `plugins@cursor.com` in the manifest).

## Repository structure

This is a multi-plugin marketplace repository. The root `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` lists all plugins, and each plugin has its own manifest:

```
plugins/
├── .cursor-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json       # Marketplace manifest (lists all plugins)
├── plugin-name/
│   ├── .cursor-plugin/
│   │   └── plugin.json        # Per-plugin manifest
│   ├── skills/                # Agent skills (SKILL.md with frontmatter)
│   ├── rules/                 # Cursor rules (.mdc files)
│   ├── mcp.json               # MCP server definitions
