## Frappe HR

Frappe HR has everything you need to drive excellence within the company. It's a complete HRMS solution with over 13 different modules right from Employee Management, Onboarding, Leaves, to Payroll, Taxation, and more!

## Motivation
When Frappe team started growing in terms of size, we needed an open-source HR and Payroll software. We didn't find any "true" open-source HR software out there and so decided to build one ourselves.
Initially, it was a set of modules within ERPNext but version 14 onwards, as the modules became more mature, Frappe HR was created as a separate product.

## Key Features

- **Employee Lifecycle**: From onboarding employees, managing promotions and transfers, all the way to documenting feedback with exit interviews, make life easier for employees throughout their life cycle.
- **Leave and Attendance**: Configure leave policies, pull regional holidays with a click, check-in and check-out with geolocation capturing, track leave balances and attendance with reports.
- **Expense Claims and Advances**: Manage employee advances, claim expenses, configure multi-level approval workflows, all this with seamless integration with ERPNext accounting.
- **Performance Management**: Track goals, align goals with key result areas (KRAs), enable employees to evaluate themselves, make managing appraisal cycles easy.
- **Payroll & Taxation**: Create salary structures, configure income tax slabs, run standard payroll, accomodate additional salaries and off cycle payments, view income breakup on salary slips and so much more.
- **Frappe HR Mobile App**: Apply for and approve leaves on the go, check-in and check-out, access employee profile right from the mobile app.

### Under the Hood

- [**Frappe Framework**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): A full-stack web application framework written in Python and Javascript. The framework provides a robust foundation for building web applications, including a database abstraction layer, user authentication, and a REST API.

- [**Frappe UI**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): A Vue-based UI library, to provide a modern user interface. The Frappe UI library provides a variety of components that can be used to build single-page applications on top of the Frappe Framework.

## Production Setup

### Managed Hosting

You can try [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com), a simple, user-friendly and sophisticated [open-source](https://github.com/frappe/press) platform to host Frappe applications with peace of mind.

It takes care of installation, setup, upgrades, monitoring, maintenance and support of your Frappe deployments. It is a fully featured developer platform with an ability to manage and control multiple Frappe deployments.

Wait for some time until the setup script creates a site. After that you can access `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and the login screen for HR should show up.

Use the following credentials to log in:

- Username: `Administrator`
- Password: `admin`

### Local

1. Set up bench by following the [Installation Steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation) and start the server and keep it running
	```sh

	```
2. In a separate terminal window, run the following commands
	```sh
	$ bench new-site hrms.local
	$ bench get-app erpnext
	$ bench get-app hrms
	$ bench --site hrms.local install-app hrms
