# Self-hosting
To self-host Librum you need to run [Librum-Server](https://github.com/Librum-Reader/Librum-Server) locally (instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Librum-Reader/Librum-Server#self-hosting)) and tell the client to use your self-hosted server by:
- (Linux) Editing ~/.config/Librum-Reader/Librum.conf and setting `selfHosted=true` and `serverHost` to your server's url (e.g. `serverHost=https://127.0.0.1:5001`)
- (Windows) Opening the registry editor (Press `Win + R` and search for `regedit`), navigating to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Librum-Reader\Librum` and setting `selfHosted=true` and `serverHost` to your server's url

Make sure to run the application before following the steps above, to generate the required files.

# Build Guide

Follow this guide to build Librum from source.
<br>


## For GNU/Linux

### Prerequisites
- cmake                             (https://cmake.org/download)
- make                              (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make)
- g++                               (https://gcc.gnu.org)
- python3-venv                      (on ubuntu use `sudo apt install python3-venv`)
- Qt 6.5                            (https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)

### Installation
The installation is straight forward, just follow the steps below:

<br>

1. Clone the repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Librum-Reader/Librum.git --recursive
    ```
2. Step into the cloned project folder.
    ```sh
    cd Librum
    ```
3. Create the build folder and step into it.
    ```sh
    mkdir build-Release
    cd build-Release
    ```
4. Run cmake.
    ```sh
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=Off -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path/to/Qt> ..
    ```
    Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to your Qt installation path. Installing Qt via the online installer usually installs it to `/home/<name>/Qt/<version>/gcc_64`
6. Build the project
    ```sh
    cmake --build . -j $(nproc)
    ```
7. Install Librum
    ```sh
    cmake --install .
    ```
<br>

### Troubleshooting
Here are solutions to some common errors. If your error is not listed here, please open an issue.
<br>

- Error: `Failed to find required Qt component "Quick".`<br>
- Solution: Install the libGL mesa dev package, on ubuntu its `sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev` and on fedora its `sudo dnf install mesa-libGL-devel`.

- Error: `Could not load the qt platform plugin "xcb" even though it was found`
- Solution: Install the libxcb-cursor-dev, on ubuntu its `sudo apt install libxcb-cursor-dev`

<br>


## For Windows
### Prerequisites
- cmake                             (https://cmake.org/download)
- Visual Studio <b>19</b>           (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/vs/older-downloads)
- Python                            (https://www.python.org/downloads)
- Qt 6.5                            (https://www.qt.io/download-open-source)

### Installation
To build Librum on windows, run the following commands in the Powershell:

<br>

1. Clone the repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Librum-Reader/Librum.git --recursive
    ```
2. Step into the cloned project folder.
    ```sh
    cd Librum
    ```
3. Create the build folder and step into it.
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
4. Run cmake.
    ```sh
    cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=Off -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path/to/qt> ..
    ```
    Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to your Qt installation path. Installing Qt via the online installer usually installs it to `<Drive>\\Qt\\<version>\\msvc2019_64`
6. Build the project
    ```sh
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```
7. Run the app
    ```sh
    ./librum
    ```

### Additional Info
Here are some things to keep in mind during the build process.
<br>

- Make sure to add cmake and the Qt binaries to the `PATH` environment variable
- You need Visual Studio 2019, newer versions will **not** work
- For the Qt installation, you **only** need to choose "MSVC 2019 64-bit", you can untick everything else to reduce the download size

<br>

## For MacOS

### Prerequisites
- cmake                             (https://cmake.org/download)
- make                              (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make)
- g++                               (https://gcc.gnu.org)
- python3                           (https://www.python.org/downloads)

    ```
4. Run cmake.
    ```sh
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTS=Off -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path/to/Qt> ..
