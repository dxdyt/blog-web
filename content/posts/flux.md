The weights of the autoencoder are also released under [apache-2.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/choosealicense/licenses/blob/main/markdown/apache-2.0.md) and can be found in the HuggingFace repos above.

## API usage

Our API offers access to our models. It is documented here:
[docs.bfl.ml](https://docs.bfl.ml/).

In this repository we also offer an easy python interface. To use this, you
first need to register with the API on [api.bfl.ml](https://api.bfl.ml/), and
create a new API key.

To use the API key either run `export BFL_API_KEY=<your_key_here>` or provide
it via the `api_key=<your_key_here>` parameter. It is also expected that you
have installed the package as above.

Usage from python:

```python
from flux.api import ImageRequest

# this will create an api request directly but not block until the generation is finished
request = ImageRequest("A beautiful beach", name="flux.1.1-pro")
# or: request = ImageRequest("A beautiful beach", name="flux.1.1-pro", api_key="your_key_here")

# any of the following will block until the generation is finished
request.url
# -> https:<...>/sample.jpg
request.bytes
# -> b"..." bytes for the generated image
request.save("outputs/api.jpg")
# saves the sample to local storage
request.image
# -> a PIL image
```

Usage from the command line:

```bash
$ python -m flux.api --prompt="A beautiful beach" url
https:<...>/sample.jpg

# generate and save the result
$ python -m flux.api --prompt="A beautiful beach" save outputs/api

# open the image directly
$ python -m flux.api --prompt="A beautiful beach" image show
```
