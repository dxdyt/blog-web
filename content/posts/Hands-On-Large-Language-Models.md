## Table of Contents

We advise to run all examples through Google Colab for the easiest setup. Google Colab allows you to use a T4 GPU with 16GB of VRAM for free. All examples were mainly built and tested using Google Colab, so it should be the most stable platform. However, any other cloud provider should work.

## Reviews

> "*Jay and Maarten have continued their tradition of providing beautifully illustrated and insightful descriptions of complex topics in their new book. Bolstered with working code, timelines, and references to key papers, their book is a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand the main techniques behind how Large Language Models are built.*"
>    
> **Andrew Ng** - founder of [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)

---

> "*This is an exceptional guide to the world of language models and their practical applications in industry. Its highly-visual coverage of generative, representational, and retrieval applications of language models empowers readers to quickly understand, use, and refine LLMs. Highly recommended!*"
>
> **Nils Reimers** - Director of Machine Learning at Cohere | creator of [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers)

---

> "*I can’t think of another book that is more important to read right now. On every single page, I learned something that is critical to success in this era of language models.*"
> 
> **Josh Starmer** - [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

> "*If you’re looking to get up to speed in everything regarding LLMs, look no further! In this wonderful book, Jay and Maarten will take you from zero to expert in the history and latest advances in large language models. With very intuitive explanations, great real-life examples, clear illustrations, and comprehensive code labs, this book lifts the curtain on the complexities of transformer models, tokenizers, semantic search, RAG, and many other cutting-edge technologies. A must read for anyone interested in the latest AI technology!*"

> "*Hands-On Large Language Models brings clarity and practical examples to cut through the hype of AI. It provides a wealth of great diagrams and visual aids to supplement the clear explanations. The worked examples and code make concrete what other books leave abstract. The book starts with simple introductory beginnings, and steadily builds in scope. By the final chapters, you will be fine-tuning and building your own large language models with confidence.*"

## [Bonus content!](bonus/)

We attempted to put as much information into the book without it being overwhelming. However, even with a 400-page book there is still much to discover! 

We continue to create more guides that compliment the book and go more in-depth into new and [exciting topics]((bonus/)):
