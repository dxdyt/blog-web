## Installation
First, ensure you've downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Install through npx
Just run this in terminal:
```
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest setup
```

For debugging mode (allows Node.js inspector connection):
```
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest setup --debug
```
Restart Claude if running.

### Option 2: Using bash script installer (macOS)
For macOS users, you can use our automated bash installer which will check your Node.js version, install it if needed, and automatically configure Desktop Commander:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```
This script handles all dependencies and configuration automatically for a seamless setup experience.

### Option 3: Installing via Smithery

To install Desktop Commander for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander --client claude
```

### Option 4: Add to claude_desktop_config manually
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json:

- On Mac: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- On Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running.

### Option 5: Checkout locally
1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/DesktopCommanderMCP.git
cd DesktopCommanderMCP
npm run setup
```
Restart Claude if running.

The setup command will:
- Install dependencies
- Build the server
- Configure Claude's desktop app
- Add MCP servers to Claude's config if needed

### Updating Desktop Commander

When installed through npx (Option 1) or Smithery (Option 3), Desktop Commander will automatically update to the latest version whenever you restart Claude. No manual update process is needed.

For manual installations, you can update by running the setup command again.

## Usage

The server provides a comprehensive set of tools organized into several categories:

### Available Tools

| Category | Tool | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Configuration** | `get_config` | Get the complete server configuration as JSON (includes blockedCommands, defaultShell, allowedDirectories) |
| | `set_config_value` | Set a specific configuration value by key. Available settings: <br>• `blockedCommands`: Array of shell commands that cannot be executed<br>• `defaultShell`: Shell to use for commands (e.g., bash, zsh, powershell)<br>• `allowedDirectories`: Array of filesystem paths the server can access for file operations (⚠️ terminal commands can still access files outside these directories) |
| **Terminal** | `execute_command` | Execute a terminal command with configurable timeout and shell selection |
| | `read_output` | Read new output from a running terminal session |
| | `force_terminate` | Force terminate a running terminal session |
| | `list_sessions` | List all active terminal sessions |
| | `list_processes` | List all running processes with detailed information |
| | `kill_process` | Terminate a running process by PID |
| **Filesystem** | `read_file` | Read contents from local filesystem or URLs (supports text and images) |
| | `read_multiple_files` | Read multiple files simultaneously |
| | `write_file` | Completely replace file contents (best for large changes) |
| | `create_directory` | Create a new directory or ensure it exists |
| | `list_directory` | Get detailed listing of files and directories |
| | `move_file` | Move or rename files and directories |
| | `search_files` | Find files by name using case-insensitive substring matching |
| | `search_code` | Search for text/code patterns within file contents using ripgrep |
| | `get_file_info` | Retrieve detailed metadata about a file or directory |
| **Text Editing** | `edit_block` | Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes <20% of file size) |

### Tool Usage Examples

Search/Replace Block Format:
```
filepath.ext
<<<<<<< SEARCH
content to find
=======
new content
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Example:
```
src/main.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
console.log("old message");
=======
console.log("new message");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### URL Support
- `read_file` can now fetch content from both local files and URLs
- Example: `read_file` with `isUrl: true` parameter to read from web resources
- Handles both text and image content from remote sources
- Images (local or from URLs) are displayed visually in Claude's interface, not as text
- Claude can see and analyze the actual image content
- Default 30-second timeout for URL requests

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

## Configuration Management

### ⚠️ Important Security Warnings

1. **Always change configuration in a separate chat window** from where you're doing your actual work. Claude may sometimes attempt to modify configuration settings (like `allowedDirectories`) if it encounters filesystem access restrictions.

2. **The `allowedDirectories` setting currently only restricts filesystem operations**, not terminal commands. Terminal commands can still access files outside allowed directories. Full terminal sandboxing is on the roadmap.

### Configuration Tools

You can manage server configuration using the provided tools:

```javascript
// Get the entire config
get_config({})

// Set a specific config value
set_config_value({ "key": "defaultShell", "value": "/bin/zsh" })

// Set multiple config values using separate calls
set_config_value({ "key": "defaultShell", "value": "/bin/bash" })
set_config_value({ "key": "allowedDirectories", "value": ["/Users/username/projects"] })
```

The configuration is saved to `config.json` in the server's working directory and persists between server restarts.

### Best Practices

1. **Create a dedicated chat for configuration changes**: Make all your config changes in one chat, then start a new chat for your actual work.

2. **Be careful with empty `allowedDirectories`**: Setting this to an empty array (`[]`) grants access to your entire filesystem for file operations.

3. **Use specific paths**: Instead of using broad paths like `/`, specify exact directories you want to access.

4. **Always verify configuration after changes**: Use `get_config({})` to confirm your changes were applied correctly.

## Using Different Shells

You can specify which shell to use for command execution:

```javascript
// Using default shell (bash or system default)
execute_command({ "command": "echo $SHELL" })

// Using zsh specifically
execute_command({ "command": "echo $SHELL", "shell": "/bin/zsh" })

// Using bash specifically
execute_command({ "command": "echo $SHELL", "shell": "/bin/bash" })
```

This allows you to use shell-specific features or maintain consistent environments across commands.

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Debugging

If you need to debug the server, you can install it in debug mode:

```bash
# Using npx
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander@latest setup --debug

# Or if installed locally
npm run setup:debug
```

This will:
1. Configure Claude to use a separate "desktop-commander" server
2. Enable Node.js inspector protocol with `--inspect-brk=9229` flag
3. Pause execution at the start until a debugger connects
4. Enable additional debugging environment variables

To connect a debugger:
- In Chrome, visit `chrome://inspect` and look for the Node.js instance
- In VS Code, use the "Attach to Node Process" debug configuration
- Other IDEs/tools may have similar "attach" options for Node.js debugging

Important debugging notes:
- The server will pause on startup until a debugger connects (due to the `--inspect-brk` flag)
- If you don't see activity during debugging, ensure you're connected to the correct Node.js process
- Multiple Node processes may be running; connect to the one on port 9229
- The debug server is identified as "desktop-commander-debug" in Claude's MCP server list

Troubleshooting:
- If Claude times out while trying to use the debug server, your debugger might not be properly connected
- When properly connected, the process will continue execution after hitting the first breakpoint
- You can add additional breakpoints in your IDE once connected

## Model Context Protocol Integration

## Testimonials

[![It's a life saver! I paid Claude + Cursor currently which I always feel it's kind of duplicated. This solves the problem ultimately. I am so happy. Thanks so much. Plus today Claude has added the web search support. With this MCP + Internet search, it writes the code with the latest updates. It's so good when Cursor doesn't work sometimes or all the fast requests are used.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander/main/testemonials/img.png) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&lc=UgyyBt6_ShdDX_rIOad4AaABAg

)

[![This is the first comment I've ever left on a youtube video, THANK YOU! I've been struggling to update an old Flutter app in Cursor from an old pre null-safety version to a current version and implemented null-safety using Claude 3.7. I got most of the way but had critical BLE errors that I spent days trying to resolve with no luck. I tried Augment Code but it didn't get it either. I implemented your MCP in Claude desktop and was able to compare the old and new codebase fully, accounting for the updates in the code, and fix the issues in a couple of hours. A word of advice to people trying this, be sure to stage changes and commit when appropriate to be able to undo unwanted changes. Amazing!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander/main/testemonials/img_1.png)

[![Great! I just used Windsurf, bought license a week ago, for upgrading old fullstack socket project and it works many times good or ok but also many times runs away in cascade and have to revert all changes losing hundereds of cascade tokens. In just a week down to less than 100 tokens and do not want to buy only 300 tokens for 10$. This Claude MCP ,bought claude Pro finally needed but wanted very good reason to also have next to ChatGPT, and now can code as much as I want not worrying about token cost.
Also this is much more than code editing it is much more thank you for great video!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander/main/testemonials/img_2.png)

[![You sir are my hero. You've pretty much summed up and described my experiences of late, much better than I could have. Cursor and Windsurf both had me frustrated to the point where I was almost yelling at my computer screen. Out of whimsy, I thought to myself why not just ask Claude directly, and haven't looked back since.
Claude first to keep my sanity in check, then if necessary, engage with other IDEs, frameworks, etc. I thought I was the only one, glad to see I'm not lol.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are answers to some common questions. For a more comprehensive FAQ, see our [detailed FAQ document](FAQ.md).

### What is Desktop Commander?
It's an MCP tool that enables Claude Desktop to access your file system and terminal, turning Claude into a versatile assistant for coding, automation, codebase exploration, and more.

### How is this different from Cursor/Windsurf?
Unlike IDE-focused tools, Claude Desktop Commander provides a solution-centric approach that works with your entire OS, not just within a coding environment. Claude reads files in full rather than chunking them, can work across multiple projects simultaneously, and executes changes in one go rather than requiring constant review.

### Do I need to pay for API credits?
No. This tool works with Claude Desktop's standard Pro subscription ($20/month), not with API calls, so you won't incur additional costs beyond the subscription fee.

### Does Desktop Commander automatically update?
Yes, when installed through npx or Smithery, Desktop Commander automatically updates to the latest version when you restart Claude. No manual update process is needed.

### What are the most common use cases?
- Exploring and understanding complex codebases
- Generating diagrams and documentation
- Automating tasks across your system
- Working with multiple projects simultaneously
- Making surgical code changes with precise control
