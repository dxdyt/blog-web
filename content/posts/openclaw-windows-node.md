## Projects

This monorepo contains the Windows hub, shared client libraries, and CLI utilities:

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI** | System tray application (WinUI 3) for quick access to OpenClaw |
| **OpenClaw.Shared** | Shared gateway client library |
| **OpenClaw.Cli** | CLI validator for WebSocket connect/send/probe using tray settings |

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **End-user installer?** Download the latest stable x64 or ARM64 installer from the [OpenClaw Windows docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/windows), or see [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for step-by-step installation (no build required).
>
> **Managed WSL gateway?** Local setup creates a locked-down app-owned `OpenClawGateway` distro. See [docs/WSL_GATEWAY_ADMIN.md](docs/WSL_GATEWAY_ADMIN.md) for editing `openclaw.json` as the `openclaw` user and using root for protected-file administration.

Direct downloads from the latest OpenClaw release:

- [OpenClawCompanion-Setup-x64.exe](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/latest/download/OpenClawCompanion-Setup-x64.exe)
- [OpenClawCompanion-Setup-arm64.exe](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/latest/download/OpenClawCompanion-Setup-arm64.exe)
- [OpenClawCompanion-SHA256SUMS.txt](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/latest/download/OpenClawCompanion-SHA256SUMS.txt)

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10 (20H2+) or Windows 11
- .NET 10.0 SDK - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0
- Windows 10 SDK (for WinUI build) - install via Visual Studio or standalone
- WebView2 Runtime - pre-installed on modern Windows, or get from https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2

### Build

Use the build script to check prerequisites and build:

```powershell
# Check prerequisites
.\build.ps1 -CheckOnly

# Build all projects
.\build.ps1

# Build specific project
.\build.ps1 -Project WinUI
```

Or build directly with dotnet:

```powershell
# Build all (use build.ps1 for best results)
dotnet build

# Build WinUI (requires runtime identifier for WebView2 support)
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI.csproj -r win-arm64  # ARM64
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI.csproj -r win-x64    # x64

# Build MSIX package (for camera/mic consent prompts)
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI -r win-arm64 -p:PackageMsix=true  # ARM64 MSIX
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI -r win-x64 -p:PackageMsix=true    # x64 MSIX
```

### Run Tray App

```powershell
# Build and launch the unpackaged WinUI tray app
.\run-app-local.ps1

# If you already built, skip rebuild and launch the existing Debug output
.\run-app-local.ps1 -NoBuild

# Run isolated from your normal tray settings so multiple worktrees can run together
.\run-app-local.ps1 -Isolated

# Alpha update testing from a Release build
.\run-app-local.ps1 -Configuration Release -Isolated -UpdateChannel alpha

# Optional: launch through WinAppCLI with Package.appxmanifest
.\run-app-local.ps1 -UseWinApp -NoBuild
```

The default path starts the unpackaged executable directly. `-UseWinApp` requires
Microsoft WinAppCLI (`winget install Microsoft.WinAppCLI`) and is only needed when
you want manifest/MSIX-adjacent launch validation.

### Run CLI WebSocket Validator

Use the CLI to validate gateway connectivity and `chat.send` outside the tray UI.

```powershell
# Show help
dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Cli -- --help

# Use tray settings from %APPDATA%\OpenClawTray\settings.json and send one message
dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Cli -- --message "quick send validation"

# Loop sends and also probe sessions/usage/nodes APIs
dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Cli -- --repeat 5 --delay-ms 1000 --probe-read --verbose

# Override gateway URL/token for isolated testing
dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Cli -- --url ws://127.0.0.1:18789 --token "<token>" --message "override test"
```

## 📦 OpenClaw.Tray (Molty)

Modern Windows 11-style system tray companion that connects to your local OpenClaw gateway.

### Features
- 🦞 **Lobster branding** - Pixel-art lobster tray icon with status colors
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Windows 11 flyout menu with dark/light mode support
- 💬 **Quick Send** - Send messages via global hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C)

- 🚀 **Auto-start** - Launch with Windows
- ⚙️ **Settings** - Full configuration page
- 🎯 **First-run onboarding** — 6-screen setup wizard (connection, permissions, chat, configuration)

#### Quick Send scope requirement

Quick Send uses the gateway `chat.send` method and requires the operator device to have `operator.write` scope.

If Quick Send fails with `missing scope: operator.write`, Molty now copies identity + remediation guidance to your clipboard, including:

- operator role and `client.id` used by the tray app
- gateway-reported operator device id (if provided)
- currently granted scopes (if provided)

For this specific error (`missing scope: operator.write`), the cause is an **operator token scope issue**. Update the token used by the tray app so it includes `operator.write`, then retry Quick Send.

If Quick Send fails with `pairing required` / `NOT_PAIRED`, that is a **device approval** issue. Approve the tray device in gateway pairing approvals, reconnect, and retry.

### Menu Sections
- **Status** - Gateway connection status with click-to-view details
- **Command Center** - Hub with diagnostics, channel health, usage, sessions, nodes, and copyable repair commands

### Windows-Only Features

These features are available in Windows but not in the Mac app:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Quick Send hotkey | Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C global hotkey |
| Embedded Web Chat | WebView2-based chat window |
| Toast notifications | Clickable Windows notifications |
| Channel control | Start/stop Telegram & WhatsApp |
| Modern flyout menu | Windows 11-style with dark/light mode |
| Deep links | `openclaw://` URL scheme with IPC |
| First-run onboarding | 6-screen guided setup wizard (Welcome → Connection → Wizard → Permissions → Chat → Ready) |

### 🔌 Node Mode (Agent Control)

When Node Mode is enabled in Settings, your Windows PC becomes a **node** that the OpenClaw agent can control - just like the Mac app! The agent can:

| Capability | Commands | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **System** | `system.notify`, `system.run`, `system.run.prepare`, `system.which`, `system.execApprovals.get`, `system.execApprovals.set` | Show Windows toast notifications, execute commands with policy controls |
| **Canvas** | `canvas.present`, `canvas.hide`, `canvas.navigate`, `canvas.eval`, `canvas.snapshot`, `canvas.a2ui.push`, `canvas.a2ui.pushJSONL`, `canvas.a2ui.reset` | Display and control a WebView2 window |
| **Screen** | `screen.snapshot`, `screen.record` | Capture screenshots and fixed-duration MP4 screen recordings |
| **Camera** | `camera.list`, `camera.snap`, `camera.clip` | Enumerate cameras and capture still photos or short video clips |
| **Speech-to-text** | `stt.transcribe` | Capture audio from the default microphone for a bounded duration and return transcribed text. Default-off; opt-in via Settings. When enabled, advertised to both gateway callers (subject to gateway allowlist) and local MCP clients (subject to bearer token). |
| **Location** | `location.get` | Return Windows geolocation when permission is available |
| **Device** | `device.info`, `device.status` | Return Windows host/app metadata and lightweight status |
| **Text-to-speech** | `tts.speak` | Speak text aloud through Windows speech synthesis, or ElevenLabs when configured |

Packaged installs declare camera, microphone, and location capabilities. Windows may ask for consent the first time a node capability uses one of those protected resources.

#### Node Setup

1. **Enable Node Mode** in Settings (enabled by default)
2. **First connection** creates a pairing request on the gateway
3. **Approve the device** on your gateway:
   ```bash
   openclaw devices list          # Find your Windows device
   openclaw devices approve <id>  # Approve it
   ```
4. **Configure gateway allowCommands** - Add the commands you want to allow under `gateway.nodes` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "gateway": {
       "nodes": {
         "allowCommands": [
           "system.notify",
           "system.run",
           "system.run.prepare",
           "system.which",
           "system.execApprovals.get",
           "system.execApprovals.set",
           "canvas.present",
           "canvas.hide",
           "canvas.navigate",
           "canvas.eval",
           "canvas.snapshot",
           "canvas.a2ui.push",
           "canvas.a2ui.pushJSONL",
           "canvas.a2ui.reset",
           "screen.snapshot",
           "camera.list",
           "camera.snap",
           "camera.clip",
           "location.get",
           "device.info",
           "device.status",
           "tts.speak"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
    > ⚠️ **Important**: The gateway has a server-side allowlist. Commands must be listed explicitly - wildcards like `canvas.*` don't work! Privacy-sensitive commands such as `screen.record` and agent-driven audio playback via `tts.speak` should only be added to `allowCommands` when you explicitly want to allow them.

5. **Test it** from your Mac/gateway:
   ```bash
    # Show a notification
    openclaw nodes notify --node <id> --title "Hello" --body "From Mac!"
    
    # Open a canvas window
    openclaw nodes canvas present --node <id> --url "https://example.com"
    
    # Execute JavaScript (note: CLI sends "javaScript" param)
    openclaw nodes canvas eval --node <id> --javaScript "document.title"
    
    # Render A2UI JSONL in the canvas (pass the file contents as a string)
    openclaw nodes canvas a2ui push --node <id> --jsonl "$(cat ./ui.jsonl)"
    
    # Take a screenshot
    openclaw nodes invoke --node <id> --command screen.snapshot --params '{"screenIndex":0,"format":"png"}'

    # Record a short screen clip (requires explicitly allowing screen.record on the gateway)
    openclaw nodes screen record --node <id> --duration 3000 --fps 10 --screen 0 --no-audio --out /tmp/openclaw-windows-screen-record-test.mp4 --json

    # List cameras
    openclaw nodes invoke --node <id> --command camera.list

    # Take a photo (NV12/MediaCapture fallback)
    openclaw nodes invoke --node <id> --command camera.snap --params '{"deviceId":"<device-id>","format":"jpeg","quality":80}'

    # Speak text aloud on the Windows node (requires TTS enabled in Settings and tts.speak allowed on the gateway)
    openclaw nodes invoke --node <id> --command tts.speak --params '{"text":"Hello from OpenClaw","provider":"windows"}'

    # Execute a command on the Windows node
    openclaw nodes invoke --node <id> --command system.run --params '{"command":"Get-Process | Select -First 5","shell":"powershell","timeoutMs":10000}'

    # View exec approval policy
    openclaw nodes invoke --node <id> --command system.execApprovals.get

    # Update exec approval policy (add custom rules)
    openclaw nodes invoke --node <id> --command system.execApprovals.set --params '{"rules":[{"pattern":"echo *","action":"allow"},{"pattern":"*","action":"deny"}],"defaultAction":"deny"}'
    ```
    > 📷 **Camera permission**: Desktop builds rely on Windows Privacy settings. Packaged MSIX builds will show the system consent prompt.
    
    > 🔒 **Exec Policy**: `system.run` is gated by an approval policy on the Windows node at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClawTray\exec-policy.json` (schema: `{ "defaultAction": "...", "rules": [...] }`). This is separate from gateway-side `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`.
    >
    > Rules are matched against the full command line. Known wrapper payloads such as `cmd /c ...`, `powershell -Command ...`, `pwsh -EncodedCommand ...`, and `bash -c ...` are also evaluated before execution. Dangerous environment overrides like `PATH`, `PATHEXT`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `LD_*`, and `DYLD_*` are rejected.

#### Command Center diagnostics

Open the status detail/Command Center from the tray menu or with `openclaw://commandcenter`. It shows:

- channel health from gateway `health` events, including node-mode health received without a separate operator connection
- active sessions, usage/cost data, node inventory, declared commands, and Mac parity notes
- allowlist diagnostics that separate safe companion commands from privacy-sensitive opt-ins like `screen.record`, `camera.snap`, and `camera.clip`
- copyable repair commands for safe allowlist fixes and pending pairing approval
- recent activity and node invoke results through the Activity Stream, storing command names/status/duration only (not payloads, screenshots, recordings, or secrets)
    >
    > ```bash
    > openclaw nodes invoke --node <id> --command system.execApprovals.set --params '{"rules":[{"pattern":"powershell.exe","action":"allow"},{"pattern":"pwsh.exe","action":"allow"},{"pattern":"echo *","action":"allow"},{"pattern":"*","action":"deny"}],"defaultAction":"deny"}'
    > ```

    > 🔐 **Web Chat secure context**: Remote web chat requires `https://` (or localhost). If using a self-signed cert, trust it in Windows (Trusted Root Certification Authorities) or use an SSH tunnel to localhost.

#### Node Status in Tray Menu

The tray menu shows node connection status:
- **🔌 Node Mode** section appears when enabled
- **⏳ Waiting for approval...** - Device needs approval on gateway
- **✅ Paired & Connected** - Ready to receive commands
- Click the device ID to copy it for the approval command

### First Run

On first run, Molty launches a guided onboarding wizard that walks you through setup:

1. **Welcome** — introduces OpenClaw and starts the setup flow
2. **Connection** — choose Local gateway, Remote gateway, or configure later. Paste a setup code or enter gateway URL and token manually. Tests the connection with Ed25519 device authentication.
3. **Wizard** — gateway-driven configuration steps (AI provider selection, personality setup, communication channels). Steps are defined by your gateway.
4. **Permissions** — reviews Windows system permissions (notifications, camera, microphone, screen capture, location) and links to system settings to grant them.
5. **Chat** — meet your agent in a live chat powered by the gateway's web UI.
6. **Ready** — summary of available features, option to launch at startup, and a Finish button.

For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md). For the full onboarding architecture, see [docs/ONBOARDING_WIZARD.md](docs/ONBOARDING_WIZARD.md).
