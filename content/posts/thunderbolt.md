**AI You Control: Choose your models. Own your data. Eliminate vendor lock-in.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ **We are excited about the amount of interest Thunderbolt has been getting and want to clarify that it is still early and under active development**. Currently, we are targeting enterprise customers that want to deploy it on-prem. We encourage you to self-host it and try it out, but there are a few caveats we are still working on:
>
> - While we eventually plan to make Thunderbolt fully offline-first, it currently depends on authentication and search functionality (though you can disable search on the integrations screen in the app). You can [deploy your own backend with Docker](./deploy/README.md) and sign up in order to test it locally.
> - You’ll need to add your own model providers - we don’t yet have a public inference endpoint. We recommend using Thunderbolt with [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) if you want free local inference, or you can add API keys for any OpenAI-compatible model provider in the settings.

Thunderbolt is an open-source, cross-platform AI client that can be deployed on-prem anywhere.

- 🌐 Available on all major desktop and mobile platforms: web, iOS, Android, Mac, Linux, and Windows.
- 🧠 Compatible with frontier, local, and on-prem models.
- 🙋 Enterprise features, support, and FDEs available.

**Thunderbolt is under active development, currently undergoing a security audit, and preparing for enterprise production readiness.**
