## 🎯 What is Motia?

**Motia solves backend fragmentation.** 

Modern software engineering is splintered – APIs live in one framework, background jobs in another, queues have their own tooling, and AI agents are springing up in yet more isolated runtimes. **This fragmentation demands a unified system.**

Motia unifies APIs, background jobs, workflows, and AI agents into a **single coherent system** with shared observability and developer experience. Similar to how React simplified frontend development where everything is a component, **Motia simplifies backend development where everything is a Step**.

Write **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more** in the same workflow. **What used to take 5 frameworks to build now comes out of the box with Motia.**

## 🚀 Quickstart

Get Motia project up and running in **under 60 seconds**:

### 1. Bootstrap a New Motia Project

```bash
npx motia@latest create -i   # runs the interactive terminal
```

Follow the prompts to pick a template, project name, and language.

### 2. Start the Workbench

Inside your new project folder, launch the dev server:

```bash
npx motia dev # ➜ http://localhost:3000
```

This spins up the Motia Workbench – a local UI for building, testing & observing your backend in real-time.

### 🧱 The Step Philosophy

**Everything is a Step** – similar to how React made everything a component, Motia makes every backend pattern a Step:

- **🎯 Steps Represent Distinct Entry Points**: APIs, background jobs, scheduled tasks, and AI agents – all unified under a single primitive
- **🌍 Any Language, One Workflow**: Write **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more** in the same project. Use Python for AI agents, TypeScript for APIs, JavaScript for workflows – all sharing state effortlessly  
- **⚡ Enterprise-Grade, Out of the Box**: Get **event-driven architecture, fault tolerance, observability, and real-time streaming** without complex infrastructure setup
- **👁️ Automatic Observability**: Complete end-to-end tracing, structured logging, and state visualization. **No setup required** – works in both local development and production
- **🌊 Composable Workflows**: Connect Steps by emitting and subscribing to events. Build complex, multi-stage processes with simple, declarative code
- **🏪 Unified State Management**: All Steps share a traced key-value store. Every `get`, `set`, and `delete` is automatically tracked across your entire workflow
- **🔄 Built-in Fault Tolerance**: Retry mechanisms, error handling, and queue infrastructure abstracted away – focus on business logic, not infrastructure

---

## 🚧 The Fragmentation Problem

Today, backend engineers face several recurring challenges:

- **🧩 Fragmented Systems**: APIs in Express, background jobs in Celery/BullMQ, AI agents in LangChain – each with different deployment, debugging, and scaling patterns
- **🌐 Multi-Language Barriers**: AI tools in Python, business logic in TypeScript – forcing teams to choose between cutting-edge tech and their existing skillset  
- **🔍 Observability Gaps**: Tracing requests across multiple frameworks and runtimes is complex and often incomplete
- **⚖️ Scalability vs. Velocity**: Choose between fast development (monolith) or proper scaling (microservices complexity)
- **🚀 Deployment Complexity**: Multiple runtimes mean multiple deploy targets, configs, and failure points

**The rapid advancement of AI has made this worse** – many cutting-edge AI tools are only available in specific languages, forcing companies to abandon their existing tech stack or miss out on breakthrough technologies.

---

## ✅ The Motia Solution

**Motia removes this limitation** by unifying your entire backend into a single runtime where everything is a **Step**:

### 🎯 **Unified vs. Fragmented**
- **Before**: APIs in Express, jobs in BullMQ, AI agents in LangChain
- **After**: All backend patterns as composable Steps with shared state and observability

### 🌐 **True Multi-Language Support**  
- **Before**: Choose between Python AI tools OR your existing TypeScript stack
- **After**: Each Step can be written in any language while sharing common state – use Python for AI, TypeScript for APIs, JavaScript for workflows

### 🔍 **Built-in Observability**
- **Before**: Complex tracing setups across multiple frameworks
- **After**: Complete observability toolkit available in both cloud and local environments out of the box

### ⚖️ **Scalability Without Complexity**
- **Before**: Choose between monolith simplicity or microservice complexity  
- **After**: Each Step scales independently, avoiding bottlenecks while maintaining development velocity

### 🚀 **One-Click Everything**
- **Before**: Multiple deployment pipelines, configs, and failure points
- **After**: Single deployable with atomic blue/green deployments and instant rollbacks

| **Traditional Stack**       | **Motia**                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Multiple deployment targets | **Single unified deployment**           |
| Fragmented observability    | **End-to-end tracing**                  |
| Language silos              | **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc** |
| Context-switching overhead  | **Single intuitive model**              |
| Manual error handling       | **Automatic retries & fault tolerance** |
| Complex infrastructure      | **Zero-config queue & streaming**       |

---

## 🔧 Supported Step Types

| Type        | Trigger               | Use Case                              |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **`api`**   | HTTP Request          | Expose REST endpoints                 |
| **`event`** | Emitted Topics        | React to internal or external events  |
| **`cron`**  | Scheduled Time (cron) | Automate recurring jobs               |
| **`noop`**  | None                  | Placeholder for manual/external tasks |

---

### 🤔 How it Works

**One framework. All backend patterns.** Motia replaces your entire backend stack with a single, event-driven system:

**🚀 Replace Multiple Frameworks:**
- **Instead of**: Express/Nest.js + BullMQ + Temporal + LangChain + custom observability
- **Use**: Motia Steps with automatic observability, queuing, and multi-language support

**⚡ Simple but Powerful:**
- **Need a REST API?** Create an `api` step → instant HTTP endpoint with validation, tracing, and error handling
- **Need background processing?** Emit an event → `event` steps pick it up asynchronously with built-in retries and fault tolerance  
- **Need scheduled jobs?** Use a `cron` step → automatic scheduling with full observability
- **Need AI agents?** Write Python steps with access to the entire ecosystem (PyTorch, transformers, etc.) while sharing state with TypeScript APIs

**🔄 Event-Driven by Design:**
Each Step can emit events that trigger other Steps, creating powerful workflows that automatically handle:
- **Parallel processing** across multiple languages
- **Fault tolerance** with automatic retries  
- **Real-time updates** streamed to clients
- **Complete traceability** of every operation

**The result?** What used to require 5+ frameworks, complex deployment pipelines, and weeks of infrastructure setup now works out of the box with Motia.

## ⚡ Core Concepts

The **Step** is Motia's core primitive. The following concepts are deeply integrated with Steps to help you build powerful, complex, and scalable backends:

### 🔑 Steps & Step Types

Understand the three ways Steps are triggered:

- **HTTP (`api`)** – Build REST/GraphQL endpoints with zero boilerplate.
- **Events (`event`)** – React to internal or external events emitted by other steps.
- **Cron (`cron`)** – Schedule recurring jobs with a familiar cron syntax.

### 📣 Emit & Subscribe (Event-Driven Workflows)

Steps talk to each other by **emitting** and **subscribing** to topics. This decouples producers from consumers and lets you compose complex workflows with simple, declarative code.

### 🏪 State Management

All steps share a unified key-value state store. Every `get`, `set`, and `delete` is automatically traced so you always know when and where your data changed.

### 📊 Structured Logging

Motia provides structured, JSON logs correlated with trace IDs and step names. Search and filter your logs without regex hassle.

### 📡 Streams: Real-time Messaging

Push live updates from long-running or asynchronous workflows to clients without polling. Perfect for dashboards, progress indicators, and interactive AI agents.

### 👁️ End-to-End Observability with Traces

Every execution generates a full trace, capturing step timelines, state operations, emits, stream calls, and logs. Visualise everything in the Workbench's Traces UI and debug faster.
