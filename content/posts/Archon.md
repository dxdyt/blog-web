<h3>ðŸš€ **CURRENT VERSION** ðŸš€</h3>

**[ V6 - Tool Library and MCP Integration ]**
*Prebuilt tools, examples, and MCP server integration*

</div>

> **ðŸ”„ IMPORTANT UPDATE (March 31st)**: Archon now includes a library of prebuilt tools, examples, and MCP server integrations. Archon can now incorporate these resources when building new agents, significantly enhancing capabilities and reducing hallucinations. Note that the examples/tool library for Archon is just starting out. Please feel free to contribute examples, MCP servers, and prebuilt tools!

Archon is the world's first **"Agenteer"**, an AI agent designed to autonomously build, refine, and optimize other AI agents. 

It serves both as a practical tool for developers and as an educational framework demonstrating the evolution of agentic systems.
Archon will be developed in iterations, starting with just a simple Pydantic AI agent that can build other Pydantic AI agents,
all the way to a full agentic workflow using LangGraph that can build other AI agents with any framework.
Through its iterative development, Archon showcases the power of planning, feedback loops, and domain-specific knowledge in creating robust AI agents.

## Important Links

- The current version of Archon is V6 as mentioned above - see [V6 Documentation](iterations/v6-tool-library-integration/README.md) for details.

- I **just** created the [Archon community](https://thinktank.ottomator.ai/c/archon/30) forum over in the oTTomator Think Tank! Please post any questions you have there!

- [GitHub Kanban board](https://github.com/users/coleam00/projects/1) for feature implementation and bug squashing.

## Vision

Archon demonstrates three key principles in modern AI development:

1. **Agentic Reasoning**: Planning, iterative feedback, and self-evaluation overcome the limitations of purely reactive systems
2. **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Seamless embedding of frameworks like Pydantic AI and LangGraph within autonomous workflows
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design supporting maintainability, cost optimization, and ethical AI practices

## Getting Started with V6 (current version)

Since V6 is the current version of Archon, all the code for V6 is in both the main directory and `archon/iterations/v6-tool-library-integration` directory.

Note that the examples/tool library for Archon is just starting out. Please feel free to contribute examples, MCP servers, and prebuilt tools!

### Prerequisites
- Docker (optional but preferred)
- Python 3.11+
- Supabase account (for vector database)
- OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter API key or Ollama for local LLMs (note that only OpenAI supports streaming in the Streamlit UI currently)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/archon.git
cd archon
```

2. Run the Docker setup script:
```bash
# This will build both containers and start Archon
python run_docker.py
```

3. Access the Streamlit UI at http://localhost:8501.

> **Note:** `run_docker.py` will automatically:
> - Build the MCP server container
> - Build the main Archon container
> - Run Archon with the appropriate port mappings
> - Use environment variables from `.env` file if it exists

#### Option 2: Local Python Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/archon.git
cd archon
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the Streamlit UI:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```

4. Access the Streamlit UI at http://localhost:8501.

### Setup Process

After installation, follow the guided setup process in the Intro section of the Streamlit UI:
- **Environment**: Configure your API keys and model settings - all stored in `workbench/env_vars.json`
- **Database**: Set up your Supabase vector database
- **Documentation**: Crawl and index the Pydantic AI documentation
- **Agent Service**: Start the agent service for generating agents
- **Chat**: Interact with Archon to create AI agents
- **MCP** (optional): Configure integration with AI IDEs

The Streamlit interface will guide you through each step with clear instructions and interactive elements.
There are a good amount of steps for the setup but it goes quick!

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors when using Archon, please first check the logs in the "Agent Service" tab.
Logs specifically for MCP are also logged to `workbench/logs.txt` (file is automatically created) so please
check there. The goal is for you to have a clear error message before creating a bug here in the GitHub repo

### Updating Archon

#### Option 1: Docker
To get the latest updates for Archon when using Docker:

```bash
# Pull the latest changes from the repository (from within the archon directory)
git pull

# Rebuild and restart the containers with the latest changes
python run_docker.py
```

The `run_docker.py` script will automatically:
- Detect and remove any existing Archon containers (whether running or stopped)
- Rebuild the containers with the latest code
- Start fresh containers with the updated version

#### Option 2: Local Python Installation
To get the latest updates for Archon when using local Python installation:

```bash
# Pull the latest changes from the repository (from within the archon directory)
git pull

# Install any new dependencies
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Restart the Streamlit UI
# (If you're already running it, stop with Ctrl+C first)
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```

This ensures you're always running the most recent version of Archon with all the latest features and bug fixes.

## Archon Agents Architecture

The below diagram from the LangGraph studio is a visual representation of the Archon agent graph.

<img src="public/ArchonGraph.png" alt="Archon Graph" />

The flow works like this:

1. You describe the initial AI agent you want to create
2. The reasoner LLM creates the high level scope for the agent
3. The primary coding agent uses the scope and documentation to create the initial agent
4. Control is passed back to you to either give feedback or ask Archon to 'refine' the agent autonomously
5. If refining autonomously, the specialized agents are invoked to improve the prompt, tools, and agent configuration
6. The primary coding agent is invoked again with either user or specialized agent feedback
7. The process goes back to step 4 until you say the agent is complete
8. Once the agent is complete, Archon spits out the full code again with instructions for running it

  - Main container: Runs the Streamlit UI and graph service
  - MCP container: Provides MCP server functionality for AI IDEs
- **Local Python**: Run directly on your system with a Python virtual environment

### Docker Architecture
The Docker implementation consists of two containers:
1. **Main Archon Container**:
   - Runs the Streamlit UI on port 8501
   - Hosts the Graph Service on port 8100
   - Built from the root Dockerfile
   - Handles all agent functionality and user interactions

2. **MCP Container**:
   - Implements the Model Context Protocol for AI IDE integration
   - Built from the mcp/Dockerfile
   - Communicates with the main container's Graph Service
   - Provides a standardized interface for AI IDEs like Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, and Roo Code

When running with Docker, the `run_docker.py` script automates building and starting both containers with the proper configuration.

## Database Setup

The Supabase database uses the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE site_pages (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    url TEXT,
    chunk_number INTEGER,
    title TEXT,
    summary TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    metadata JSONB,
    embedding VECTOR(1536) -- Adjust dimensions as necessary (i.e. 768 for nomic-embed-text)
);
```

The Streamlit UI provides an interface to set up this database structure automatically.
