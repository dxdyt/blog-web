## 🎯 What is Archon?

> Archon is currently in beta! Expect things to not work 100%, and please feel free to share any feedback and contribute with fixes/new features!

Archon is the **command center** for AI coding assistants. For you, it's a sleek interface to manage knowledge, context, and tasks for your projects. For the AI coding assistant(s), it's a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** to collaborate on and leverage the same knowledge, context, and tasks. Connect Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, Windsurf, etc. to give your AI agents access to:

- **Your documentation** (crawled websites, uploaded PDFs/docs)
- **Smart search capabilities** with advanced RAG strategies  
- **Task management** integrated with your knowledge base
- **Real-time updates** as you add new content and collaborate with your coding assistant on tasks
- **Much more** coming soon to build Archon into an integrated environment for all context engineering

This new vision for Archon replaces the old one (the agenteer). Archon used to be the AI agent that builds other agents, and now you can use Archon to do that and more.

> It doesn't matter what you're building or if it's a new/existing codebase - Archon's knowledge and task management capabilities will improve the output of **any** AI driven coding.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (free tier or local Supabase both work)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (Gemini and Ollama are supported too!)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coleam00/archon.git
   cd archon
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Supabase credentials:
   # SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   # SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key-here
   ```

   NOTE: Supabase introduced a new type of service key but use the legacy one (the longer one).

   OPTIONAL: If you want to enable the reranking RAG strategy, uncomment lines 20-22 in `python\requirements.server.txt`. This will significantly increase the size of the Archon Server container which is why it's off by default.

3. **Database Setup**: In your [Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard) SQL Editor, copy, paste, and execute the contents of `migration/complete_setup.sql`

4. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
   
   This starts the core microservices:
   - **Server**: Core API and business logic (Port: 8181)
   - **MCP Server**: Protocol interface for AI clients (Port: 8051)
   - **Agents (coming soon!)**: AI operations and streaming (Port: 8052)
   - **UI**: Web interface (Port: 3737)

   Ports are configurable in your .env as well!

5. **Configure API Keys**:
   - Open http://localhost:3737
   - Go to **Settings** → Select your LLM/embedding provider and set the API key (OpenAI is default)
   - Test by uploading a document or crawling a website

## 🔄 Database Reset (Start Fresh if Needed)

If you need to completely reset your database and start fresh:

<details>
<summary>⚠️ <strong>Reset Database - This will delete ALL data for Archon!</strong></summary>

1. **Run Reset Script**: In your Supabase SQL Editor, run the contents of `migration/RESET_DB.sql`
   
   ⚠️ WARNING: This will delete all Archon specific tables and data! Nothing else will be touched in your DB though.

2. **Rebuild Database**: After reset, run `migration/complete_setup.sql` to create all the tables again.

3. **Restart Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Reconfigure**: 
   - Select your LLM/embedding provider and set the API key again
   - Re-upload any documents or re-crawl websites

The reset script safely removes all tables, functions, triggers, and policies with proper dependency handling.

</details>

## ⚡ Quick Test

Once everything is running:

1. **Test Web Crawling**: Go to http://localhost:3737 → Knowledge Base → "Crawl Website" → Enter a doc URL (such as https://ai.pydantic.dev/llms-full.txt)
2. **Test Document Upload**: Knowledge Base → Upload a PDF
3. **Test Projects**: Projects → Create a new project and add tasks
4. **Integrate with your AI coding assistant**: MCP Dashboard → Copy connection config for your AI coding assistant

## Architecture

### Microservices Structure

Archon uses true microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Frontend UI   │    │  Server (API)   │    │   MCP Server    │    │ Agents Service  │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │    │                 │

                         │    PGVector     │
                         └─────────────────┘
```

### Service Responsibilities

| Service | Location | Purpose | Key Features |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Frontend** | `archon-ui-main/` | Web interface and dashboard | React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Socket.IO client |
| **Server** | `python/src/server/` | Core business logic and APIs | FastAPI, service layer, Socket.IO broadcasts, all ML/AI operations |
| **MCP Server** | `python/src/mcp/` | MCP protocol interface | Lightweight HTTP wrapper, 10 MCP tools, session management |
| **Agents** | `python/src/agents/` | PydanticAI agent hosting | Document and RAG agents, streaming responses |

### Communication Patterns

- **HTTP-based**: All inter-service communication uses HTTP APIs
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time updates from Server to Frontend  
- **MCP Protocol**: AI clients connect to MCP Server via SSE or stdio
- **No Direct Imports**: Services are truly independent with no shared code dependencies

### Key Architectural Benefits

- **Lightweight Containers**: Each service contains only required dependencies
- **Independent Scaling**: Services can be scaled independently based on load
- **Development Flexibility**: Teams can work on different services without conflicts
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service uses the best tools for its specific purpose

## 🔧 Configuring Custom Ports & Hostname

By default, Archon services run on the following ports:
- **Archon-UI**: 3737
- **Archon-Server**: 8181  
- **Archon-MCP**: 8051
- **Archon-Agents**: 8052
- **Archon-Docs**: 3838 (optional)

### Changing Ports

To use custom ports, add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Service Ports Configuration
ARCHON_UI_PORT=3737
ARCHON_SERVER_PORT=8181
ARCHON_MCP_PORT=8051
ARCHON_AGENTS_PORT=8052
ARCHON_DOCS_PORT=3838
```

Example: Running on different ports:
```bash
ARCHON_SERVER_PORT=8282
ARCHON_MCP_PORT=8151
```

### Configuring Hostname

By default, Archon uses `localhost` as the hostname. You can configure a custom hostname or IP address by setting the `HOST` variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Hostname Configuration
HOST=localhost  # Default

# Examples of custom hostnames:
HOST=192.168.1.100     # Use specific IP address
HOST=archon.local      # Use custom domain
HOST=myserver.com      # Use public domain
```

This is useful when:
- Running Archon on a different machine and accessing it remotely
- Using a custom domain name for your installation
- Deploying in a network environment where `localhost` isn't accessible

After changing hostname or ports:
1. Restart Docker containers: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
2. Access the UI at: `http://${HOST}:${ARCHON_UI_PORT}`
3. Update your AI client configuration with the new hostname and MCP port

## 🔧 Development

For development with hot reload:

```bash
# Backend services (with auto-reload)
docker-compose up archon-server archon-mcp archon-agents --build

# Frontend (with hot reload) 
cd archon-ui-main && npm run dev

# Documentation (with hot reload)
cd docs && npm start
```

**Note**: The backend services are configured with `--reload` flag in their uvicorn commands and have source code mounted as volumes for automatic hot reloading when you make changes.

## 📄 License

Archon Community License (ACL) v1.2 - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

**TL;DR**: Archon is free, open, and hackable. Run it, fork it, share it - just don't sell it as-a-service without permission.
