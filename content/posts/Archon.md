## 🎯 What is Archon?

> Archon is currently in beta! Expect things to not work 100%, and please feel free to share any feedback and contribute with fixes/new features! Thank you to everyone for all the excitement we have for Archon already, as well as the bug reports, PRs, and discussions. It's a lot for our small team to get through but we're committed to addressing everything and making Archon into the best tool it possibly can be!

Archon is the **command center** for AI coding assistants. For you, it's a sleek interface to manage knowledge, context, and tasks for your projects. For the AI coding assistant(s), it's a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** to collaborate on and leverage the same knowledge, context, and tasks. Connect Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, Windsurf, etc. to give your AI agents access to:

- **Your documentation** (crawled websites, uploaded PDFs/docs)
- **Smart search capabilities** with advanced RAG strategies
- **Task management** integrated with your knowledge base
- **Real-time updates** as you add new content and collaborate with your coding assistant on tasks
- **Much more** coming soon to build Archon into an integrated environment for all context engineering

This new vision for Archon replaces the old one (the agenteer). Archon used to be the AI agent that builds other agents, and now you can use Archon to do that and more.

> It doesn't matter what you're building or if it's a new/existing codebase - Archon's knowledge and task management capabilities will improve the output of **any** AI driven coding.

</p>

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) (for hybrid development mode)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (free tier or local Supabase both work)
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (Gemini and Ollama are supported too!)
- (OPTIONAL) [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (see [Installing Make](#installing-make) below)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone -b stable https://github.com/coleam00/archon.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd archon
   ```
   
   **Note:** The `stable` branch is recommended for using Archon. If you want to contribute or try the latest features, use the `main` branch with `git clone https://github.com/coleam00/archon.git`
2. **Environment Configuration**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Supabase credentials:
   # SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   # SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key-here
   ```

   IMPORTANT NOTES:
   - For cloud Supabase: they recently introduced a new type of service role key but use the legacy one (the longer one).
   - For local Supabase: set SUPABASE_URL to http://host.docker.internal:8000 (unless you have an IP address set up).

3. **Database Setup**: In your [Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard) SQL Editor, copy, paste, and execute the contents of `migration/complete_setup.sql`

4. **Start Services** (choose one):

   **Full Docker Mode (Recommended for Normal Archon Usage)**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

   This starts all core microservices in Docker:
   - **Server**: Core API and business logic (Port: 8181)
   - **MCP Server**: Protocol interface for AI clients (Port: 8051)
   - **UI**: Web interface (Port: 3737)

   Ports are configurable in your .env as well!

5. **Configure API Keys**:
   - Open http://localhost:3737
   - You'll automatically be brought through an onboarding flow to set your API key (OpenAI is default)

## ⚡ Quick Test

Once everything is running:

1. **Test Web Crawling**: Go to http://localhost:3737 → Knowledge Base → "Crawl Website" → Enter a doc URL (such as https://ai.pydantic.dev/llms-full.txt)
2. **Test Document Upload**: Knowledge Base → Upload a PDF
3. **Test Projects**: Projects → Create a new project and add tasks
4. **Integrate with your AI coding assistant**: MCP Dashboard → Copy connection config for your AI coding assistant

<details>
<summary>⚠️ <strong>Reset Database - This will delete ALL data for Archon!</strong></summary>

1. **Run Reset Script**: In your Supabase SQL Editor, run the contents of `migration/RESET_DB.sql`

   ⚠️ WARNING: This will delete all Archon specific tables and data! Nothing else will be touched in your DB though.

2. **Rebuild Database**: After reset, run `migration/complete_setup.sql` to create all the tables again.

3. **Restart Services**:

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile full up -d
   ```

4. **Reconfigure**:
   - Select your LLM/embedding provider and set the API key again

### Service Responsibilities

| Service        | Location             | Purpose                      | Key Features                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend**   | `archon-ui-main/`    | Web interface and dashboard  | React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Socket.IO client                   |
| **Server**     | `python/src/server/` | Core business logic and APIs | FastAPI, service layer, Socket.IO broadcasts, all ML/AI operations |
| **MCP Server** | `python/src/mcp/`    | MCP protocol interface       | Lightweight HTTP wrapper, MCP tools, session management         |
| **Agents**     | `python/src/agents/` | PydanticAI agent hosting     | Document and RAG agents, streaming responses                       |

### Communication Patterns

- **HTTP-based**: All inter-service communication uses HTTP APIs
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time updates from Server to Frontend
- **MCP Protocol**: AI clients connect to MCP Server via SSE or stdio
- **No Direct Imports**: Services are truly independent with no shared code dependencies

### Key Architectural Benefits

- **Lightweight Containers**: Each service contains only required dependencies
- **Independent Scaling**: Services can be scaled independently based on load
- **Development Flexibility**: Teams can work on different services without conflicts
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service uses the best tools for its specific purpose

## 🔧 Configuring Custom Ports & Hostname

By default, Archon services run on the following ports:

- **archon-ui**: 3737
- **archon-server**: 8181
- **archon-mcp**: 8051
- **archon-agents**: 8052
- **archon-docs**: 3838 (optional)

### Changing Ports

To use custom ports, add these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Service Ports Configuration
ARCHON_UI_PORT=3737
ARCHON_SERVER_PORT=8181
ARCHON_MCP_PORT=8051
ARCHON_AGENTS_PORT=8052
ARCHON_DOCS_PORT=3838
```

Example: Running on different ports:

```bash
ARCHON_SERVER_PORT=8282
ARCHON_MCP_PORT=8151
```

### Configuring Hostname

By default, Archon uses `localhost` as the hostname. You can configure a custom hostname or IP address by setting the `HOST` variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Hostname Configuration
HOST=localhost  # Default

# Examples of custom hostnames:
HOST=192.168.1.100     # Use specific IP address
HOST=archon.local      # Use custom domain
HOST=myserver.com      # Use public domain
```

This is useful when:

- Running Archon on a different machine and accessing it remotely
- Using a custom domain name for your installation
- Deploying in a network environment where `localhost` isn't accessible

After changing hostname or ports:

1. Restart Docker containers: `docker compose down && docker compose --profile full up -d`
2. Access the UI at: `http://${HOST}:${ARCHON_UI_PORT}`
3. Update your AI client configuration with the new hostname and MCP port

## 🔧 Development

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Start development (recommended)
make dev        # Backend in Docker, frontend local with hot reload

# Alternative: Everything in Docker
make dev-docker # All services in Docker

# Stop everything (local FE needs to be stopped manually)
make stop
```

### Development Modes

#### Hybrid Mode (Recommended) - `make dev`

Best for active development with instant frontend updates:

- Backend services run in Docker (isolated, consistent)
- Frontend runs locally with hot module replacement
- Instant UI updates without Docker rebuilds

#### Full Docker Mode - `make dev-docker`

For all services in Docker environment:

- All services run in Docker containers
- Better for integration testing
- Slower frontend updates

### Testing & Code Quality

```bash
# Run tests
make test       # Run all tests
make test-fe    # Run frontend tests
make test-be    # Run backend tests

# Run linters
make lint       # Lint all code
make lint-fe    # Lint frontend code
make lint-be    # Lint backend code

# Check environment
make check      # Verify environment setup

# Clean up
make clean      # Remove containers and volumes (asks for confirmation)
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# View logs using Docker Compose directly
docker compose logs -f              # All services
docker compose logs -f archon-server # API server
docker compose logs -f archon-mcp    # MCP server
docker compose logs -f archon-ui     # Frontend
```

**Note**: The backend services are configured with `--reload` flag in their uvicorn commands and have source code mounted as volumes for automatic hot reloading when you make changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Port Conflicts

If you see "Port already in use" errors:

```bash
# Check what's using a port (e.g., 3737)
lsof -i :3737

# Stop all containers and local services
make stop

# Change the port in .env
```

#### Docker Permission Issues (Linux)

If you encounter permission errors with Docker:

```bash
# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Log out and back in, or run
newgrp docker
```

#### Windows-Specific Issues

- **Make not found**: Install Make via Chocolatey, Scoop, or WSL2 (see [Installing Make](#installing-make))
- **Line ending issues**: Configure Git to use LF endings:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf false
  ```

#### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend

- Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8181/health`
- Verify port configuration in `.env`
- For custom ports, ensure both `ARCHON_SERVER_PORT` and `VITE_ARCHON_SERVER_PORT` are set

#### Docker Compose Hangs

If `docker compose` commands hang:

```bash
# Reset Docker Compose
docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker system prune -f

# Restart Docker Desktop (if applicable)
```

#### Hot Reload Not Working

- **Frontend**: Ensure you're running in hybrid mode (`make dev`) for best HMR experience
- **Backend**: Check that volumes are mounted correctly in `docker-compose.yml`
- **File permissions**: On some systems, mounted volumes may have permission issues
