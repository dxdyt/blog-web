## ESP32-BlueJammer
The ESP32-BlueJammer (Bluetooth jammer, BLE jammer, WiFi jammer, RC jammer) disrupts various devices using an ESP32 and nRF24 modules, causing plenty of noise and sending unnecessary packets (DoS).              
                                                                    
It interrupts:  
**The whole 2.4GHz broadband!** Everything that works on 2.4GHz is being interfered, like:                                                       
audio in speakers being transmitted over bluetooth, microphones on 2.4GHz, smartphone connections, WiFi, RC Drones (etc.), IoT devices, smart gadgets, wireless keyboard & mouse, just anything on 2.4GHz!

Ideal for controlled disruption and security testing. Based on 2.4GHz communication.

It has a big range (over 30Meters+ - may vary on your antenna and hardware setup!) on newest Bluetooth versions with casual 2.4GHz antennas, you can easily increase this as well by taking some simple "bigger" router antennas.
An amplifier (2.4GHz) may be a good option too!

Remember that jamming is illegal and should not be used with malicious intent!



## PCB's with ESP32 and RF-module capability
**ESP32-RF DIY-PCB:**
This PCB can fit an ESP32-wroom-32U/E DevKitC and 2 nRF-modules, along with an 0.96" I2C OLED, LEDs and switches.

**PRE-SOLDERED:**  "The Blue ESP"  
This is an ESP32 with RF-module breakouts (nRF24/CC1101 etc.) for experimenting.  
***Remember: It is not intended for illegal use, neither for my project!***  

**Required:**  
- **[nRF24L01+PA+LNA](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_oma5UQx)** (2x)  
Why do you need to get the nRF24's? -> the pinout can be used to connect either nRF24 or CC1101 modules for further experiments with an ESP32 chip.

## Operation Channels
- **Bluetooth** = 79CH  
  Frequency Range: 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz  
  Channel Width: 1 MHz

- **BLE** = 40CH  
  Frequency Range: 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz  
  Channel Width: 2 MHz

- **WiFi** = 14CH  
  Frequency Range: 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz  
  Channel Width: Typically 20 MHz, but can be 22 MHz or 40 MHz in some cases

- **RC drones, etc.** = 1-125CH  
  Frequency Range: 2.400 GHz to 2.525 GHz  
  Channel Width: 1 MHz



## How to use?
To disrupt various channels on the 2.4GHz band, do the following to enable your ESP32-BlueJammer:
- Every mode starts right away after powering on the device! There is no additional button to start the attack!  
- It simply jams right away once powered!

### Combo-Channel-Select_BT-BLE-WiFi-RC firmware:
- use the "Boot" button on the ESP32 to switch between the channel modes on the Combo-Firmware!
- the OLED will display your current operation channel
- the status LED lets you know about the current state you're in:  
1 blink = BT  
2 blinks = BLE  
3 blinks = WiFi  
4 blinks = RC  
- the serial output of your ESP32-BlueJammer will output the following lines when switching mode:  
State 1: Bluetooth  
State 2: Bluetooth Low Energy  
State 3: WiFi  
State 4: RC  

### all other firmware:
- the firmware you choose indicates the operation channel by its name, this means:

Bluetooth_80_CH - jams classic Bluetooth  
Frequency Range: 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz  

BluetoothLowEnergy_40_CH - jams Bluetooth Low Energy  
Frequency Range: 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz  

Bluetooth-BluetoothLowEnergy_40-80_CH - jams classic Bluetooth & Bluetooth Low Energy  
Frequency Range: 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz & 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz  

Bluetooth-WiFi_14-80_CH - jams classic Bluetooth & WiFi  
Frequency Range: 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz & 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz  

WiFi_14_CH - jams WiFi  
Frequency Range: 2.400 GHz to 2.4835 GHz  

2.4GHzRemoteControl(Drones etc.)_1-125_CH - jams RC (Drones etc.)  
  Frequency Range: 2.400 GHz to 2.525 GHz

## Antennas
A frequently asked question is whether the antennas are needed and what the third antenna is for, here is the answer:
Yes, you need at least both antennas for the nRF24's! Why? To have it working on a decent range!
The average range with standard known chinese 2.4GHz antennas is about 20-30meters. Upgrading those antennas will help a lot with getting more range!

2 antennas are for the HSPI and VSPI nRF24 modules!

The 3rd antenna is plugged to the ESP32 chip itself, whether via IPEX or soldered onto its own antenna, if your ESP32 does not provide any option to add that one, it obviously won't be possible!
What is the 3rd antenna used for? The third antenna connected to the ESP32 chip itself helps with reliable long-range interference. It ensures a better intermediate signal and stability when jamming!
(The third antenna is your own decision and therefore optional!)



## Flashing the firmware
### via webflasher (Easy)  
![ESP32-BlueJammerFlasher](https://dwdwpld.pages.dev/ESP32BlueJammerFlasher.png)

## About the ESP32-BlueJammer and my source code
- **Is my ESP32-BlueJammer really working?**  
  Yes! My ESP32 BlueJammer is fully functional, and no one pauses the sound in the demo video. Many people have built their own ESP32-BlueJammer and confirmed that it works! Join my Discord and see for yourself! ;D

- **Why my ESP32-BlueJammer code is NOT open source**  
  There are several "BLE Jammers" available on GitHub, but they all have limitations in frequency range, channel coverage, and effective distance (around 5 meters). Therefore I decided to develop and code my own firmware for the ESP32-BlueJammer, aiming for superior performance.

  Despite some claims that I might have copied someone else's work, it's important to clarify that extracting source code from a compiled file (.hex, .bin, etc.) is practically impossible. If I had used someone else's work, I wouldn't have been able to create custom console banners, develop multiple firmware versions, or build a web flasher. My code is entirely written from scratch. There is nothing taken from other available codes, sources, codebases or resources as a foundation, if any even exist. My code remains closed source for now, to protect the significant effort and innovation I've invested in this project.

  This isn't my last project. I'm looking forward to implementing the ESP32-BlueJammer in further ongoing projects, so for now, I'd like the code to remain closed source. Maybe someday I'll make it open source!  
  -no one knows. ;D
