> **Autonomous AI development loop with intelligent exit detection and rate limiting**

Ralph is an implementation of the Geoffrey Huntley's technique for Claude Code that enables continuous autonomous development cycles he named after [Ralph Wiggum](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). It enables continuous autonomous development cycles where Claude Code iteratively improves your project until completion, with built-in safeguards to prevent infinite loops and API overuse.

**Install once, use everywhere** - Ralph becomes a global command available in any directory.

## Quick Start

Ralph has two phases: **one-time installation** and **per-project setup**.

```
INSTALL ONCE              USE MANY TIMES
+-----------------+          +----------------------+
| ./install.sh    |    ->    | ralph-setup project1 |
|                 |          | ralph-setup project2 |
| Adds global     |          | ralph-setup project3 |
| commands        |          | ...                  |
+-----------------+          +----------------------+
```

### Phase 1: Install Ralph (One Time Only)

Install Ralph globally on your system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code.git
cd ralph-claude-code
./install.sh
```

This adds `ralph`, `ralph-monitor`, and `ralph-setup` commands to your PATH.

> **Note**: You only need to do this once per system. After installation, you can delete the cloned repository if desired.

### Phase 2: Initialize New Projects (Per Project)

For each new project you want Ralph to work on:

#### Option A: Import Existing PRD/Specifications
```bash
# Convert existing PRD/specs to Ralph format (recommended)
ralph-import my-requirements.md my-project
cd my-project

# Review and adjust the generated files:
# - PROMPT.md (Ralph instructions)
# - @fix_plan.md (task priorities)
# - specs/requirements.md (technical specs)

# Start autonomous development
ralph --monitor
```

#### Option B: Manual Project Setup
```bash
# Create blank Ralph project
ralph-setup my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project

# Configure your project requirements manually
# Edit PROMPT.md with your project goals
# Edit specs/ with detailed specifications
# Edit @fix_plan.md with initial priorities

# Start autonomous development
ralph --monitor
```

### Ongoing Usage (After Setup)

Once Ralph is installed and your project is initialized:

```bash
# Navigate to any Ralph project and run:
ralph --monitor              # Integrated tmux monitoring (recommended)

# Or use separate terminals:
ralph                        # Terminal 1: Ralph loop
ralph-monitor               # Terminal 2: Live monitor dashboard
```

## How It Works

Ralph operates on a simple but powerful cycle:

1. **Read Instructions** - Loads `PROMPT.md` with your project requirements
2. **Execute Claude Code** - Runs Claude Code with current context and priorities
3. **Track Progress** - Updates task lists and logs execution results
4. **Evaluate Completion** - Checks for exit conditions and project completion signals
5. **Repeat** - Continues until project is complete or limits are reached

### Intelligent Exit Detection

Ralph automatically stops when it detects:
- All tasks in `@fix_plan.md` marked complete
- Multiple consecutive "done" signals from Claude Code
- Too many test-focused loops (indicating feature completeness)
- Strong completion indicators in responses
- Claude API 5-hour usage limit reached (with user prompt to wait or exit)

## Importing Existing Requirements

Ralph can convert existing PRDs, specifications, or requirement documents into the proper Ralph format using Claude Code.

### Supported Formats
- **Markdown** (.md) - Product requirements, technical specs
- **Text files** (.txt) - Plain text requirements
- **JSON** (.json) - Structured requirement data
- **Word documents** (.docx) - Business requirements
- **PDFs** (.pdf) - Design documents, specifications
- **Any text-based format** - Ralph will intelligently parse the content

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Convert a markdown PRD
ralph-import product-requirements.md my-app

# Convert a text specification
ralph-import requirements.txt webapp

# Convert a JSON API spec
ralph-import api-spec.json backend-service

# Let Ralph auto-name the project from filename
ralph-import design-doc.pdf
```

### What Gets Generated

Ralph-import creates a complete project with:

- **PROMPT.md** - Converted into Ralph development instructions
- **@fix_plan.md** - Requirements broken down into prioritized tasks
- **specs/requirements.md** - Technical specifications extracted from your document
- **Standard Ralph structure** - All necessary directories and template files

The conversion is intelligent and preserves your original requirements while making them actionable for autonomous development.

### Modern CLI Features (v0.9.8)

Ralph-import uses modern Claude Code CLI features for improved reliability:

- **JSON Output Format**: Structured responses enable precise parsing of conversion results
- **Automatic Fallback**: Gracefully handles older CLI versions with text-based parsing
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Extracts specific error messages and codes from JSON responses
- **Session Tracking**: Captures session IDs for potential continuation of interrupted conversions

> **Note**: These features require Claude Code CLI version 2.0.76 or later. Older versions will work with standard text output.

## Configuration

### Rate Limiting & Circuit Breaker

Ralph includes intelligent rate limiting and circuit breaker functionality:

```bash
# Default: 100 calls per hour
ralph --calls 50

# With integrated monitoring
ralph --monitor --calls 50

# Check current usage
ralph --status
```

The circuit breaker automatically:
- Detects API errors and rate limit issues with advanced two-stage filtering
- Opens circuit after 3 loops with no progress or 5 loops with same errors
- Eliminates false positives from JSON fields containing "error"
- Accurately detects stuck loops with multi-line error matching
- Gradually recovers with half-open monitoring state
- Provides detailed error tracking and logging with state history

### Claude API 5-Hour Limit

When Claude's 5-hour usage limit is reached, Ralph:
1. Detects the limit error automatically
2. Prompts you to choose:
   - **Option 1**: Wait 60 minutes for the limit to reset (with countdown timer)
   - **Option 2**: Exit gracefully (or auto-exits after 30-second timeout)
3. Prevents endless retry loops that waste time

### Custom Prompts

```bash
# Use custom prompt file
ralph --prompt my_custom_instructions.md

# With integrated monitoring
ralph --monitor --prompt my_custom_instructions.md
```

### Execution Timeouts

```bash
# Set Claude Code execution timeout (default: 15 minutes)
ralph --timeout 30  # 30-minute timeout for complex tasks

# With monitoring and custom timeout
ralph --monitor --timeout 60  # 60-minute timeout

# Short timeout for quick iterations
ralph --verbose --timeout 5  # 5-minute timeout with progress
```

### Verbose Mode

```bash
# Enable detailed progress updates during execution
ralph --verbose

# Combine with other options
ralph --monitor --verbose --timeout 30
```

### Session Continuity

Ralph maintains session context across loop iterations for improved coherence:

```bash
# Sessions are enabled by default with --continue flag
ralph --monitor                 # Uses session continuity

# Start fresh without session context
ralph --no-continue             # Isolated iterations

# Reset session manually (clears context)
ralph --reset-session           # Clears current session

# Check session status
cat .ralph_session              # View current session file
cat .ralph_session_history      # View session transition history
```

**Session Auto-Reset Triggers:**
- Circuit breaker opens (stagnation detected)
- Manual interrupt (Ctrl+C / SIGINT)
- Project completion (graceful exit)
- Manual circuit breaker reset (`--reset-circuit`)

Sessions are persisted to `.ralph_session` with a 24-hour expiration. The last 50 session transitions are logged to `.ralph_session_history` for debugging.

### Exit Thresholds

Modify these variables in `~/.ralph/ralph_loop.sh`:

**Exit Detection Thresholds:**
```bash
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TEST_LOOPS=3     # Exit after 3 test-only loops
MAX_CONSECUTIVE_DONE_SIGNALS=2   # Exit after 2 "done" signals
TEST_PERCENTAGE_THRESHOLD=30     # Flag if 30%+ loops are test-only
```

**Circuit Breaker Thresholds:**
```bash
CB_NO_PROGRESS_THRESHOLD=3       # Open circuit after 3 loops with no file changes
CB_SAME_ERROR_THRESHOLD=5        # Open circuit after 5 loops with repeated errors
CB_OUTPUT_DECLINE_THRESHOLD=70   # Open circuit if output declines by >70%
```

## Project Structure

Ralph creates a standardized structure for each project:

```
my-project/
├── PROMPT.md           # Main development instructions for Ralph
├── @fix_plan.md        # Prioritized task list (@ prefix = Ralph control file)
├── @AGENT.md           # Build and run instructions
├── specs/              # Project specifications and requirements
│   └── stdlib/         # Standard library specifications
├── src/                # Source code implementation
├── examples/           # Usage examples and test cases
├── logs/               # Ralph execution logs
└── docs/generated/     # Auto-generated documentation
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific** - Clear requirements lead to better results
2. **Prioritize** - Use `@fix_plan.md` to guide Ralph's focus
3. **Set Boundaries** - Define what's in/out of scope
4. **Include Examples** - Show expected inputs/outputs

### Project Specifications

- Place detailed requirements in `specs/`
- Use `@fix_plan.md` for prioritized task tracking
- Keep `@AGENT.md` updated with build instructions
- Document key decisions and architecture

### Monitoring Progress

- Use `ralph-monitor` for live status updates
- Check logs in `logs/` for detailed execution history
- Monitor `status.json` for programmatic access
- Watch for exit condition signals

## System Requirements

- **Bash 4.0+** - For script execution
- **Claude Code CLI** - `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer for integrated monitoring (recommended)
- **jq** - JSON processing for status tracking
- **Git** - Version control (projects are initialized as git repos)
- **Standard Unix tools** - grep, date, etc.

### Testing Requirements (Development)

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the comprehensive testing guide.

If you want to run the test suite:

```bash
# Install BATS testing framework
npm install -g bats bats-support bats-assert

# Run all tests (276 tests)
npm test

# Run specific test suites
bats tests/unit/test_rate_limiting.bats
bats tests/unit/test_exit_detection.bats
bats tests/unit/test_json_parsing.bats
bats tests/unit/test_cli_modern.bats
bats tests/unit/test_cli_parsing.bats
bats tests/unit/test_session_continuity.bats
bats tests/integration/test_loop_execution.bats
bats tests/integration/test_prd_import.bats
bats tests/integration/test_project_setup.bats
bats tests/integration/test_installation.bats

# Run error detection and circuit breaker tests
./tests/test_error_detection.sh
./tests/test_stuck_loop_detection.sh
```

Current test status:
- **276 tests** across 11 test files
- **100% pass rate** (276/276 passing)
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Specialized tests for JSON parsing, CLI flags, circuit breaker, and installation workflows

> **Note on Coverage**: Bash code coverage measurement with kcov has fundamental limitations when tracing subprocess executions. Test pass rate (100%) is the quality gate. See [bats-core#15](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core/issues/15) for details.

### Installing tmux

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install tmux

# macOS
brew install tmux

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install tmux
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Live Dashboard

```bash
# Integrated tmux monitoring (recommended)
ralph --monitor

# Manual monitoring in separate terminal
ralph-monitor
```

Shows real-time:
- Current loop count and status
- API calls used vs. limit
- Recent log entries
- Rate limit countdown

**tmux Controls:**
- `Ctrl+B` then `D` - Detach from session (keeps Ralph running)
- `Ctrl+B` then `←/→` - Switch between panes
- `tmux list-sessions` - View active sessions
- `tmux attach -t <session-name>` - Reattach to session

### Status Checking

```bash
# JSON status output
ralph --status

# Manual log inspection
tail -f logs/ralph.log
```

### Common Issues

- **Rate Limits** - Ralph automatically waits and displays countdown
- **5-Hour API Limit** - Ralph detects and prompts for user action (wait or exit)
- **Stuck Loops** - Check `@fix_plan.md` for unclear or conflicting tasks
- **Early Exit** - Review exit thresholds if Ralph stops too soon
- **Execution Timeouts** - Increase `--timeout` value for complex operations
- **Missing Dependencies** - Ensure Claude Code CLI and tmux are installed
- **tmux Session Lost** - Use `tmux list-sessions` and `tmux attach` to reconnect
