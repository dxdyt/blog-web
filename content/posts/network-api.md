## The Nexus Network

The [Nexus Network](https://docs.nexus.xyz/network) is a global distributed prover network that unites the world's computers to power a new and better Internet: the Verifiable Internet.

There have been two testnets:

- The first testnet period was in [October 08 to 28 2024](https://blog.nexus.xyz/nexus-launches-worlds-first-open-prover-network/).
- The second testnet period was in [December 9 to 13, 2024](https://blog.nexus.xyz/the-new-nexus-testnet-is-live/).

**Important:** *The Nexus network is currently in devnet. It is important to note that you cannot earn Nexus points. Instead, devnet allows developers to experiment and build with the network. Stay tuned for updates regarding future testnets.*

## Quick Start

```bash
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
```

If you don't have Rust installed, you will be prompted to install it.

## Prerequisites

### Linux
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev git-all protobuf-compiler
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install git
```

### Windows
[Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) first, then follow Linux instructions.

## Terms of Use

Use of the CLI is subject to the [Terms of Use](https://nexus.xyz/terms-of-use). First-time users will be prompted to accept the terms. For non-interactive acceptance (e.g., CI environments), use:

```bash
NONINTERACTIVE=1 sh
```

## Prover Id

The CLI will prompt for your web prover id from the Nexus testnet or devnet on startup. It is ok to skip this prompt and a random id will be generated, but you'll be prompted again on startup until your web prover id is entered.

The prover id prompt is disabled when NONINTERACTIVE=1 is set. In a server environment,
you can manually overwrite $HOME/.nexus/prover-id with your full prover id.

## Current Limitations

- Only latest CLI version is supported
- No prebuilt binaries yet
- Proof cycle counting coming soon
- Program submission requires API key (contact growth@nexus.xyz)
