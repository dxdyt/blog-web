This is server that allows Claude desktop app to execute long-running terminal commands on your computer and manage processes through Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Built on top of [MCP Filesystem Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) to provide additional search and replace file editing capabilities .

## Features

- Execute terminal commands with output streaming
- Command timeout and background execution support
- Process management (list and kill processes)
- Session management for long-running commands
- Full filesystem operations:
  - Read/write files
  - Create/list directories
  - Move files/directories
  - Search files
  - Get file metadata
  - Code editing capabilities:
  - Surgical text replacements for small changes
  - Full file rewrites for major changes
  - Multiple file support
  - Pattern-based replacements
  - vscode-ripgrep based recursive code or text search in folders

## Installation
First, ensure you've downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Installing via Smithery

To install Desktop Commander for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander --client claude
```

### Option 2: Install trough npx
Just run this in terminal
```
npx @wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander setup
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 3: Add to claude_desktop_config by hand
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json (on Mac, found at ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running

### Option 4: Checkout locally
1. Clone and build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
npm run setup
```
Restart Claude if running

The setup command will:
- Install dependencies
- Build the server
- Configure Claude's desktop app
- Add MCP servers to Claude's config if needed

## Usage

The server provides these tool categories:

### Terminal Tools
- `execute_command`: Run commands with configurable timeout
- `read_output`: Get output from long-running commands
- `force_terminate`: Stop running command sessions
- `list_sessions`: View active command sessions
- `list_processes`: View system processes
- `kill_process`: Terminate processes by PID
- `block_command`/`unblock_command`: Manage command blacklist

### Filesystem Tools
- `read_file`/`write_file`: File operations
- `create_directory`/`list_directory`: Directory management  
- `move_file`: Move/rename files
- `search_files`: Pattern-based file search
- `get_file_info`: File metadata
- `code_search`: Recursive ripgrep based text and code search

### Edit Tools
- `edit_block`: Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes <20% of file size)
- `write_file`: Complete file rewrites (best for large changes >20% or when edit_block fails)

Search/Replace Block Format:
```
filepath.ext
<<<<<<< SEARCH
existing code to replace
=======
new code to insert
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Example:
```
src/main.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
console.log("old message");
=======
console.log("new message");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Model Context Protocol Integration

This project extends the MCP Filesystem Server to enable:
- Local server support in Claude Desktop
- Full system command execution
- Process management
- File operations
- Code editing with search/replace blocks

Created as part of exploring Claude MCPs: https://youtube.com/live/TlbjFDbl5Us

## DONE

## Work in Progress and TODOs

The following features are currently being developed or planned:

- **Better configurations** ([in progress](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeDesktopCommander/pull/16)) - Improved settings for allowed paths, commands and shell environment
- **Windows environment fixes** ([in progress](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeDesktopCommander/pull/13)) - Resolving issues specific to Windows platforms
- **Linux improvements** ([in progress](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeDesktopCommander/pull/12)) - Enhancing compatibility with various Linux distributions
- **Support for WSL** - Windows Subsystem for Linux integration
- **Support for SSH** - Remote server command execution

## Testimonials

[![It's a life saver! I paid Claude + Cursor currently which I always feel it's kind of duplicated. This solves the problem ultimately. I am so happy. Thanks so much. Plus today Claude has added the web search support. With this MCP + Internet search, it writes the code with the latest updates. It's so good when Cursor doesn't work sometimes or all the fast requests are used.](testemonials/img.png) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ly3bed99Dy8&lc=UgyyBt6_ShdDX_rIOad4AaABAg

[![This is the first comment I've ever left on a youtube video, THANK YOU! I've been struggling to update an old Flutter app in Cursor from an old pre null-safety version to a current version and implemented null-safety using Claude 3.7. I got most of the way but had critical BLE errors that I spent days trying to resolve with no luck. I tried Augment Code but it didn't get it either. I implemented your MCP in Claude desktop and was able to compare the old and new codebase fully, accounting for the updates in the code, and fix the issues in a couple of hours. A word of advice to people trying this, be sure to stage changes and commit when appropriate to be able to undo unwanted changes. Amazing!](testemonials/img_1.png)

[![Great! I just used Windsurf, bought license a week ago, for upgrading old fullstack socket project and it works many times good or ok but also many times runs away in cascade and have to revert all changes loosing hundereds of cascade tokens. In just a week down to less than 100 tokens and do not want to buy only 300 tokens for 10$. This Claude MCP ,bought claude Pro finally needed but wanted very good reason to also have next to ChatGPT, and now can code as much as I want not worrying about token cost.
Also this is much more than code editing it is much more thank you for great video!](testemonials/img_2.png)

[![it is a great tool, thank you, I like using it, as it gives claude an ability to do surgical edits, making it more like a human developer.](testemonials/img_3.png)

[![You sir are my hero. You've pretty much summed up and described my experiences of late, much better than I could have. Cursor and Windsurf both had me frustrated to the point where I was almost yelling at my computer screen. Out of whimsy, I thought to myself why not just ask Claude directly, and haven't looked back since.
Claude first to keep my sanity in check, then if necessary, engage with other IDEs, frameworks, etc. I thought I was the only one, glad to see I'm not lol.
