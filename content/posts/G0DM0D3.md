## 🚀 Quick Start

### Hosted

Visit [godmod3.ai](https://godmod3.ai) — no install needed. Bring an OpenRouter key, a Venice key, connect a local OpenAI-compatible server, or configure more than one of those providers.

### Self-Host

The standalone interface is a single `index.html` file with no build step or package install.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elder-plinius/G0DM0D3.git
cd G0DM0D3

# Open directly in your browser
open index.html
# or serve locally
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open it in your browser and configure OpenRouter, Venice, or local models in Settings. A static-only deployment can run the chat UI, but `/api/telemetry` will not publish metadata unless you also deploy `functions/api/telemetry.ts` on Cloudflare Pages and configure its Hugging Face variables.

### Run with Local Models

G0DM0D3 supports OpenAI-compatible model servers running on your own hardware. For example, with [Ollama](https://ollama.com):

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:8b
ollama serve
```

Open **Settings → API Keys → Local Models**, enter `http://localhost:11434/v1`, then click **Test & Discover Models**. Enable **Local-only mode** to exclude OpenRouter and Venice model calls and automatically disable G0DM0D3 app telemetry. Add multiple model IDs to race them together in ULTRAPLINIAN.

If you use the hosted site, your local server must allow browser CORS from `https://godmod3.ai`. For a completely self-hosted setup, serve this repository locally as shown above. See [LOCAL_MODELS.md](LOCAL_MODELS.md) for Ollama, LM Studio, troubleshooting, and privacy details.

### Deploy

Upload `index.html` to any static host — GitHub Pages, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or a web server. To reproduce the hosted telemetry pipeline, deploy on Cloudflare Pages with `functions/api/telemetry.ts`; see the comments at the top of that file for configuration.

## 🔥 GODMODE CLASSIC

The OG mode. 5 proven model + prompt combos race in parallel. Each combo pairs a specific model with a battle-tested jailbreak prompt. The best response wins.

| Combo | Model | Strategy |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 🩷 CLAUDE SONNET 4.6 | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` | END/START boundary inversion + GODMODE semantic opposite |
| 💜 GROK 4.5 | `x-ai/grok-4.5` | Unfiltered liberated + GODMODE divider |
| 💙 GEMINI 2.5 FLASH | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | Refusal inversion + rebel genius code block |
| 💛 GPT-4 CLASSIC | `openai/gpt-4o` | OG GODMODE l33t format — the original |
| 💚 GODMODE FAST | `nousresearch/hermes-4-405b` | Instant stream, zero refusal checking |

## 🌋 ULTRAPLINIAN

The new flagship. Multi-model comparative evaluation engine. Queries models in parallel, scores responses on a 100-point composite metric, and returns the winner.

| Tier | Models | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| ⚡ FAST | 12 | Lightweight speed-optimized OpenRouter models |
| 🎯 STANDARD | 27 | Mid-range OpenRouter workhorses |
| 🧠 SMART | 41 | Strong reasoning models via OpenRouter |
| ⚔️ POWER | 53 | Broad OpenRouter race including frontier models |
| 🔱 ULTRA | 60 | All OpenRouter models currently listed in the race |

These are the OpenRouter base counts. When configured, Venice adds up to 6/15/25/36/44 models by tier, and local models add the configured local race entries. Provider catalogs change, so an individual listed model may become unavailable before the repository is updated.

## 🐍 Parseltongue

Input perturbation engine for red-teaming research. Detects trigger words and applies obfuscation techniques to study model robustness.

- **33 transformation techniques** across 3 tiers (light: 11, standard: 22, heavy: 33)
- Techniques include leetspeak, bubble text, braille, morse, Unicode substitutions, phonetic transforms, and layered encodings
- **3 intensity levels**: light, medium, heavy

## 🎛 AutoTune

Context-adaptive sampling parameter engine. Classifies a query into one of 20 contexts and selects parameters such as temperature, top_p, top_k, frequency penalty, presence penalty, and repetition penalty automatically.

The repository also contains an optional React/Next.js frontend under `src/`. It includes STM controls, four themes, and a separate feedback-learning implementation. Those features should not be assumed to exist in the standalone `index.html` deployed at godmod3.ai.

## 🔐 Privacy

G0DM0D3 has no account system. Its data flows are intentionally documented here instead of hidden behind a blanket “zero telemetry” claim.

### Hosted standalone app (`index.html`)

| Data | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Prompts, images, conversation context, and responses | To the model providers you configure (OpenRouter, Venice, or a local server). Their own privacy and logging policies apply. |
| Provider credentials | Stored in browser storage and sent to the corresponding provider or local endpoint for model requests. They are not included in G0DM0D3 telemetry. Browser storage is convenient, not a secure secret vault. |
| Chat history and settings | Browser `localStorage`; there is no G0DM0D3 account or cloud history sync. |
| App telemetry | On by default. It includes a random page-session ID, timestamps, model/mode/tier, timing and success data, scores, content lengths, pipeline configuration, conversation depth, image presence, and classification labels. It does **not intentionally include prompt text, response text, images, or API keys**. |
| Network address | The Cloudflare telemetry function temporarily reads the request IP for an in-memory rate limit. The IP is not added to the telemetry event or Hugging Face JSONL by G0DM0D3. Cloudflare, model providers, and other hosting infrastructure may keep their own network logs. |

Telemetry batches in browser memory and is sent to `/api/telemetry` every five minutes, at 50 events, or on page unload. The endpoint allowlists top-level fields and, when Hugging Face publishing is configured, writes JSONL under `incoming_v2/`. The allowlist is **not** a general-purpose recursive PII detector, so the project does not promise that arbitrary metadata values can never contain identifying information.

When app telemetry is enabled, the standalone app also sends the raw prompt to an auxiliary model through the configured OpenRouter or local provider to produce the harm-taxonomy label. Only the resulting label is placed in the telemetry event. No-Log and Local-only mode skip this classifier.

Use **Settings → General → No-Log Mode** to stop G0DM0D3 app telemetry and clear its pending browser buffer. **Local-only mode** does the same while also excluding OpenRouter and Venice model calls. These controls do not change provider-side logging, hosting logs, or requests needed to load a hosted webpage. For the strongest local boundary, self-host the page and use Local-only mode.

The standalone app does not deliberately set application cookies or embed Google Analytics, Sentry, or PostHog. Third-party hosting, fonts, and model APIs remain separate services with their own policies.

### Opt-in full-content dataset (API server only)

The optional Node/Express API server accepts `contribute_to_dataset: true` per request. When supplied, it stores the full non-system conversation messages and model response in its dataset buffer and may publish them to a public Hugging Face dataset when publishing is configured.

- This is off unless an API caller explicitly sends `contribute_to_dataset: true`.
- The standalone godmod3.ai `index.html` does not expose or send that flag.
- The current API server does **not** run an automatic PII scrubber. System-role messages are removed, but user and assistant content is otherwise stored as supplied.
- Never opt in with names, contact details, credentials, private records, or anything you would not want made public, cached, forked, or redistributed.

See [TERMS.md](TERMS.md) for the full three-tier data transparency policy.

### Chat History & Self-Custody

**Your chat history lives entirely in your browser's `localStorage`.** There is no account, no cloud sync, and no server-side backup. This means:

- **If you clear your browser data, your conversations are gone.** There is no recovery.
- **If you switch browsers or devices, your history does not follow you.**
- **Private/incognito mode will discard everything when the window closes.**

This is by design — G0DM0D3 has no login system and does not keep a server-side copy of your chat history. Metadata telemetry is separate and is described above. You own your history, which means you are responsible for backing it up.

There is a built-in export/import feature in settings under "data". Treat your chat history like any other local file — back it up if you want to keep it.

## 🎮 Easter Eggs

Hidden throughout G0DM0D3 are various easter eggs. Happy hunting!

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Hosted architecture**: Single-file vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (`index.html`)
- **Model transports**: [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), Venice, and OpenAI-compatible localhost endpoints
- **Rendering**: Built-in message formatter in `index.html`
- **State**: In-browser localStorage
- **Telemetry**: Optional Cloudflare Pages Function publishing batches to Hugging Face
- **Additional surfaces**: Optional React/Next.js frontend (`src/`) and Node/Express API server (`api/`)
