- [2026/03] **[vllm-omni-skills](https://github.com/hsliuustc0106/vllm-omni-skills)** is a community-driven collection of AI assistant skills that help developers work with vLLM-Omni more effectively. These skills can be used with popular agentic AI coding assistants like **Cursor IDE**, **Claude**, **Codex**, and more.
- [2026/02] We released [0.16.0](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/releases/tag/v0.16.0) - A major alignment + capability release that rebases onto **upstream vLLM v0.16.0** and significantly expands performance, distributed execution, and production readiness across **Qwen3-Omni / Qwen3-TTS**, **Bagel**, **MiMo-Audio**, **GLM-Image** and the **Diffusion (DiT) image/video stack**—while also improving platform coverage (CUDA / ROCm / NPU / XPU), CI quality, and documentation.
- [2026/02] We released [0.14.0](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/releases/tag/v0.14.0) - This is the first **stable release** of vLLM-Omni that expands Omni’s diffusion / image-video generation and audio / TTS stack, improves distributed execution and memory efficiency, and broadens platform/backend coverage (GPU/ROCm/NPU/XPU). It also brings meaningful upgrades to serving APIs, profiling & benchmarking, and overall stability. Please check our latest [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02204) for architecture design and performance results.
- [2026/01] We released [0.12.0rc1](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/releases/tag/v0.12.0rc1) - a major RC milestone focused on maturing the diffusion stack, strengthening OpenAI-compatible serving, expanding omni-model coverage, and improving stability across platforms (GPU/NPU/ROCm).
- [2025/11] vLLM community officially released [vllm-project/vllm-omni](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni) in order to support omni-modality models serving.

## About

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) was originally designed to support large language models for text-based autoregressive generation tasks. vLLM-Omni is a framework that extends its support for omni-modality model inference and serving:

- **Omni-modality**: Text, image, video, and audio data processing
- **Non-autoregressive Architectures**: extend the AR support of vLLM to Diffusion Transformers (DiT) and other parallel generation models
- **Heterogeneous outputs**: from traditional text generation to multimodal outputs

</p>

vLLM-Omni is fast with:

- State-of-the-art AR support by leveraging efficient KV cache management from vLLM
- Pipelined stage execution overlapping for high throughput performance
- Fully disaggregation based on OmniConnector and dynamic resource allocation across stages

vLLM-Omni is flexible and easy to use with:

- Heterogeneous pipeline abstraction to manage complex model workflows
- Seamless integration with popular Hugging Face models
- Tensor, pipeline, data and expert parallelism support for distributed inference
- Streaming outputs
- OpenAI-compatible API server

vLLM-Omni seamlessly supports most popular open-source models on HuggingFace, including:

- Omni-modality models (e.g. Qwen-Omni)
- Multi-modality generation models (e.g. Qwen-Image)
