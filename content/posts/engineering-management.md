## Books

More than any other field, management is full of fluffy books that could be summarized in one 100-word article. That being said, there's a number of excellent books, listed below.

### Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders

📖 [Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404) is hands down my preferred management book.

This book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient.

It provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of **deliberate action**. There's a also [a presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/micrimson/turn-the-ship-around-041614) that talks about the main concepts the author developed.

There are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them. The narration is great as well and the explanations are short, and to the point.

You can find a short summary in video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psAXMqxwol8)

> “Control without competence is chaos.”

— L. David Marquet, Turn the Ship Around!

### Other generalist books

- 📖 [The Advantage, Enhanced Edition: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ORWT3Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1), Patrick M. Lencioni.
  - The only way for people to embrace a message is to hear it over a period of time, in a variety of different situations, and preferably from different people. That’s why great leaders see themselves as Chief Reminding Officers as much as anything else.
  - The best way to do cascading communication is face-to-face and live. Seeing a leader and hearing the tone of his or her voice is critical for employees, as is being able to ask a question or two.
  - But then again, most organizations are unhealthy precisely because they aren’t doing the basic things, which require discipline, persistence, and follow-through more than sophistication or intelligence.
- 📖 [Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1484221575): "Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp’s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose."
- 📖 Oren Ellenbogen, [Leading Snowflakes: the Engineering Manager Handbook](http://leadingsnowflakes.com/): some truly great content and concrete ideas to move from maker to manager mode, code reviewing your management decisions, delegating tasks without losing quality or visibility.
- 📖 Adam Grant, [Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFPTSI0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1): "This gem is a joy to read, and it shatters the myth that greed is the path to success.", Robert Sutton.
- 📖 Ken Blanchard, [Lead Like Jesus: Lessons from the Greatest Leadership Role Model of All Time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VF62IO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).
- 📖 Andrew S. Grove, [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015VACHOK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). A landmark book by Intel CEO Andy Grove. Introduced many of the management best practices such as 1-1, OKR.
  - Managerial leverage measures the impact of what managers do to increase the output of their teams.
  - You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.
  - Every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you’re responsible for.
  - A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible.
  - A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity).
  - A manager’s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.
  - League standings are kept by team, not by individual. Business—and this means not just the business of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the business of medicine—is a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win.
  - Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager’s life.
  - The lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization.
  - Delegation without follow-through is abdication.
  - Any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it.
  - Self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled.
  - A successful MBO [management by objective] system needs only to answer two questions: 1.  Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2.  How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results).
  - The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say “no”—in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize—and act on the realization—that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say “yes” to and what we say “no” to—which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work.
  - Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, “Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.” Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.
  - I would like to propose Grove’s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.
  - When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.
  - That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience.
  - When the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement.
  - The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external.
  - At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential.
  - A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in.
- 📖 Patrick Lencioni, [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1500281191&sr=1-1&keywords=dysfunctions).
- 📖 Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead, Laszlo Bock. A pretty interesting description of Google's processes. A bit long at times.
- 📖 [The Manager's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/) , Camille Fournier. A very practical book with lots of down-to-earth advices.

## Engineering Management Topics

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.

I don't necessarily agree with everything listed here. Actually, you'll see that some of those articles have diametrically opposed opinions. I do believe those thought-provoking resources will help you in your manager journey.

### Antipatterns

- [Seven Deadly Diseases of Management](https://deming.org/explore/seven-deadly-diseases), Dr. Deming. Great video as well. I don't necessarily agree with everything but Deming is still one of the great management thinker.

### Biases

- 📖 [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) by Daniel Kahneman and published in 2012 is already a classic. It offers a whirling tour into our biases and the limits of human judgment. Truly amazing read.
- [You're not going to believe what I'm about to tell you](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe), The Oatmeal (comics) about the backfire effect ("given evidence against their beliefs, people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly", [confirmation bias - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)).

Cognitive biases don't only apply to hiring... They can impact performance reviews, 1-1, team meetings, even small talk with colleagues.

- [The Cognitive Bias Codex](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg)

### Brainstorming

- [Extreme questions to trigger new, better ideas](https://longform.asmartbear.com/posts/extreme-questions/), A Smart Bear
  - The following prompts jostle you out of tiny thinking
  - If you were forced to increase your prices by 10x, what would you have to do to justify it?
  - If all our customers vanished, and we had to earn our growth and brand from scratch, what would we do?
  - If you were never allowed to provide tech support, in any form, what would have to change?
  - If our biggest competitor copied every single feature we have, how do we still win?
  - What if we are forced to ship a full, completed (at least MVP) new feature, in just two weeks, that would delight and surprise some fraction of our customers.
  - What if you were forced to charge customers in a completely different manner?
  - No more synchronous meetings, ever again?
  - If we could never talk to our customers again, how would we figure out what to build?
  - What if it didn’t matter how unprofitable you were?
  - What externality has the potential to kill the entire company?

> The dangerous man is the one who has only one idea, because then he’ll fight and die for it. The way real science goes is that you come up with lots of ideas, and most of them will be wrong.

— Francis Crick

  - DH4: counterargument
  - DH5: refutation
  - DH6: refuting the central point
  - Analyzing your own level of disagreement can help with unintentional intellectual dishonesty.
  - When you have something real to say, being mean gets in the way
- [Apple Pie Position](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1628567045800591361), Shreyas Doshi
  - A statement that instantly elevates the person who is saying it and is simultaneously hard for anyone else to push back on, and so everyone avoids the personal risk and just nods “yes”, even though its actual value in this specific situation might be relatively low, zero, or even negative.
  - E.g., "We need to define the success metrics for X"
  - E.g., "We need a better go-to-market motion to improve product adoption"

### CTO (Chief Technical Officer), VPoE and other levels

See also the section about [Organizational structure](#organizational-structure)

- Martin Casado, [Hire a VP of Engineering](https://a16z.com/2017/05/26/hiring-vp-engineering-why-what/) on the Andreessen Horowitz blog
  - The most important function of a VP of engineering is to build out the engineering team and set a startup’s engineering culture.
  - Competent engineering management should therefore be able to push the team towards more practical, incremental designs that can garner useful external feedback quickly — without compromising the long-term generality of the system. The VP’s role here is not producing the architecture, but ensuring that incremental release is a real requirement in the design process.
  - Strong engineering management tends to give their teams enough ownership and latitude that they are happy and fulfilled in driving the product forward.

- Will Larson, [Your first 90 days as CTO or VP Engineering.](https://lethain.com/first-ninety-days-cto-vpe/)
  - Durable improvements depend on creating systems that create changes, not performing tactical actions that create the ephemeral appearance of improvement.
  - Figure out if something is really wrong and needs immediate attention.
  - Shadow customer meetings, partner meetings or user testing.
  - Find your business analytics and how to query them.
  - Shadow existing interviews, onboarding and closing calls.
  - Kickoff engineering brand efforts.
  - Build a trivial change and deploy it.

  - “The CTO’s primary job is to make sure the company’s technology strategy serves its business strategy” — Eric Ries.
  - As a CTO, you don’t work in the box, because your task is to examine the box and make it better.
  - The CTO might code, but only on POCs and prototypes.

  - Strong interviewers need to have flexible questions that react to signals from the candidates.
- [Engineers Shouldn’t Write ETL: A Guide to Building a High Functioning Data Science Department](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/03/16/engineers-shouldnt-write-etl/)
  - You Probably Don’t Have Big Data
  - Nobody enjoys writing and maintaining data pipelines or ETL. It’s the industry’s ultimate hot potato.
  - Give data scientists ownership of the ETL end-to-end
  - Engineers design new Lego blocks that data scientists assemble in creative ways to create new data science.
  - It is absolutely essential for platform engineers to stay ahead of the data science teams
  - Engineers should see themselves as being “Tony Stark’s tailor”, building the armor that prevents data scientists from falling into pitfalls that yield unscalable or unreliable solutions.
  - We [should be ok with] sacrificing technical efficiency for velocity and autonomy

### Culture

- [The maze is in the mouse](https://medium.com/@pravse/the-maze-is-in-the-mouse-980c57cfd61a) lays out how Google's culture impeded its results and execution.
  - "It is a soft peacetime culture where nothing is worth fighting for."
  - Google employees get very little done because they are trapped in a maze of processes.
  - The culture focuses on consensus ("respect each other") and risk-avoidance at the expense of heroism or value-creating ideas/bets.
  - Each employee's mission is not about the customer but about serving a VP or a technical belief/process.
  - Most managers are [peacetime managers](https://a16z.com/2011/04/14/peacetime-ceo-wartime-ceo/) and lack a sense of urgency.
  - There is a general lack of humility regarding the internal tech stack. The delusion of exceptionalism means that employees believe everything they do is perfect.
  - "Strategy is rarely articulated clearly (that would be career risk)"

  - Non-measurement unfairly rewards people with charisma while productive but less-persuasive engineers wallow in frustration.
  - Measure Blockers at the Team Level

### Diversity and inclusion

### Employee retention

- [Theory-building and why employee churn is lethal to software companies](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/theory-building/)
  - "The death of a program happens when the programmer team possessing its theory is dissolved." Programming as Theory Building by Peter Naur, 1985.
  - Software is the insights of the development team made manifest.
  - Most code documentation becomes useful after you have built the theory in your mind
  - The most reliable method a programmer has for building an accurate ‘theory’ of a piece of software is to have been there when it was first written ("first generation programmer")
  - Too many second-generation developers and the first generation gets overwhelmed, and work stalls.
  - Too few second-generation developers and there is no renewal—each developer that leaves the team is a potential catastrophe.
  - Team stability is vital for software development

  - Companies ultimately succeed or fail by their coordinated execution, culture and leadership.

### Feedback and performance

  - So the first step to achieving the results we really want is to fix the problem of believing that others are the source of all that ails us. It’s our dogmatic conviction that “if we could just fix those losers, all would go better” that keeps us from taking action that could lead to dialogue and progress. Which is why it’s no surprise that those who are best at dialogue tend to turn this logic around. They believe the best way to work on “us” is to start with “me.”
  - Respect is like air. As long as it’s present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it’s all that people can think about.
  - “One dull pencil is worth six sharp minds.” Don’t leave your hard work to memory. If you’ve gone to the effort to complete a crucial conversation, don’t fritter away all the meaning you created by trusting your memories. Write down the details of conclusions, decisions, and assignments.

  - Vulnerability Cultivates Trust
- [Simon Sinek: Purpose should be prioritized over metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhuKJWm1_fQ&ab_channel=DenkProducties)
  - Targets are great. But how targets are reached matters too. A team that would meet its target two months later should be rewarded more than a team that reach its target at the expense of morale and quality.
  - SEALs measure performance and trust. They would rather have a medium performance high trust person on the team than a high performance low trust person.
  - Simon's team runs team peer reviews. One person shares their top three weaknesses, the team can comment but they can only say thank you, then they do the same for their strength.

### Hiring

#### General

- 📖 [Hiring The Best Knowledge Workers, Techies & Nerds: The Secrets & Science Of Hiring Technical People](https://www.amazon.com/Hiring-Knowledge-Workers-Techies-Nerds/dp/0932633595), Johanna Rothman. A solution-oriented book.
  - Train your interview team to apply a limited-consensus approach to hiring. When groups use limited consensus, not everyone may agree with the decision, but each person should be satisfied enough with a particular candidate’s suitability not to block the decision to hire him or her.
  - What if the vetoer is someone I don’t want to keep in the organization?” The answer to this is simple: In the interview process, only involve employees whose work you respect and value. If an employee isn’t successful in his or her technical position, don’t make that employee part of the interview team.
  - Make sure members of your team interview an internal candidate the same way they would interview an external candidate.
  - Know why you’re hiring more people. Define your problems to define your hiring strategy.
  - Sometimes, the main reason a hiring manager doesn’t hire a candidate is that he or she has a gut feeling that the person just won’t fit well with the culture. But a “gut feeling” is not a good reason not to hire someone, so train yourself to articulate culture-fit differences.
  - I personally do not consider certification to mean anything much when I am hiring someone for a technical position. Because the knowledge tested is functional-skills book knowledge, make sure you understand what the person must do to maintain his or her certification and the value of that certification to your environment.
  - Too often, internal recruiters look for tool and technology expertise or for advanced academic degrees, rather than for functional skill or for product-domain experience.
  - If you feel the need to take notes, take them on paper, never on a computer. My reason for this is that when you use a computer, you have to sit behind a screen, which creates a barrier between you and the candidate.
  - Promising an unconditional promotion is not just risky; it is stupid. Circumstances within the company can change; the employee may not perform up to expectations; the economy may tank.

- [This is why you never end up hiring good developers](http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/)
  - Many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life;
  - You want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now;
  - Or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly;
  - You want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do;
  - Your interview should be a collaborative conversations, not a combative interrogation;
  - You also want somebody who you will enjoy working with;
  - It’s important to separate “enjoy working with” from “enjoy hanging out with;”
  - Don’t hire assholes, no matter how good they are;
  - If your team isn’t diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be;
  - Accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard.

Lawrence Bossidy, GE

> I hire people brighter than me and then I get out of their way.

Lee Iacocca, Ford

> You can dream, create, design and build the most wonderful place in the world... but it requires people to make the dream a reality.

Peter Schutz, Porsche

> In technology, it's about the people. Getting the best people, retaining them, nurturing a creative environment, and helping to find a way to innovate.

Marissa Mayer

Jeff Bezos

> Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.

Michael Jordan, American former professional basketball player

> Often the best solution to a management problem is the right person.

Edwin Booz

> Somebody once said that in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if you don't have the first, the other two will kill you. You think about it; it's true. If you hire somebody without [integrity], you really want them to be dumb and lazy.

Warren Buffet

> One cannot hire a hand; the whole man always comes with it.

Peter Drucker

> If you think it's expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur.

- [Excerpts from One From Many, Dee Hock](https://twitter.com/zackkanter/status/1272200276015853569), Zack Kanter on Twitter.
  - Your first responsibility as a manager is to manage yourself: your integrity, character, ethics, knowledge, wisdom, temperament, words and acts.
  - The second responsibility is to manage those who have authority over us.
  - The third responsibility is to manage your peers: without their respect and confidence, nothing can be accomplished.
  - The fourth responsibility is to manage those whom we have authority.
  - You can't manage your bosses, peers, regulators etc. But you can understand them, motivate them, influence them, forgive them.
  - "It is from failure that amazing growth and grace so often come, provided only that one can recognise it, admit it, learn from it, rise above it, and try again. True leadership presumes a standard quite beyond human perfectibility and that is quite alright, for joy and satisfaction are in the pursuit of an objective, not in its realization."

  - Good managers are skilled at asking questions that give their team members a new perspective on the problem and reach the right solution on their own.

### Organizational structure

See also [Data organization](#data-organization)

- [Spotify’s Failed #SquadGoals](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/)
  - Engineering managers in this model had little responsibility beyond the career development of the people they managed.
  - There was no single person accountable for the engineering team’s delivery or who could negotiate prioritization of work at an equivalent level of responsibility.
  - Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.
  - Business units, departments, teams, and managers more effectively communicate organization structure roles and responsibilities than Spotify’s synonyms and are not attached to a way of working that failed their creator.
- [Independence,autonomy,too many small teams](https://kislayverma.com/organizations/independence-autonomy-and-too-many-small-teams/)
  - Every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself, without a lot of overlap with other teams.
  - The team should be able to meets its goals independently (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams).
  - Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team.
- 🎞 [Monoliths vs Microservices is Missing the Point—Start with Team Cognitive Load](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haejb5rzKsM&ab_channel=ITRevolution) by the authors of team topologies.
- [Organizing software teams](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-structure-teams-for-building-better-software-products-91e4dea021d) (Team Topologies Book Summary)
  - There should be no shared ownership of components, libraries, or code.
  - If you have microservices but are still waiting to do end-to-end testing of a combination of services, you have a distributed monolith (a distributed monolith is when all changes in a service require updates to other services).
  - Use software boundaries defined by business-domain bounded contexts
  - Teams composed of only people with single functional expertise should be avoided at all costs.
  - Four fundamental team topologies: stream-aligned, enabling, complicated subsystem, platform.
- [Structure Eats Strategy](https://janbosch.com/blog/index.php/2017/11/25/structure-eats-strategy/)
  - BAPO: the B (business) should define the A (architecture) which is the starting point for the P (process), on which the O (organization) is based.
  - Most companies are not BAPO but instead they are OPAB: the existing organization is used as a basis for the definition of convenience-driven processes, which in turn leads to an accidental architecture.

### Production and productivity

- [The Toyota Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way), Wikipedia

  - Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time
  - Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.
  - Use visual control so no problems are hidden.
  - Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.
  - Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.
  - Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.
  - Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.
  - Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation
  - Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options; implement decisions rapidly
  - Become a learning organization through relentless reflection (hansei) and continuous improvement (kaizen)

    - Deficiencies do not make you special. The older you get, the more your inability to cook will be a red flag for people.
    - History remembers those who got to market first. Getting your creation out into the world is more important than getting it perfect.
    - Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation.
    - You do not live in a video game. There are no pop-up warnings if you’re about to do something foolish, or if you’ve been going in the wrong direction for too long. You have to create your own warnings.
    - Cultivate a reputation for being dependable. Good reputations are valuable because they’re rare (easily destroyed and hard to rebuild). You don’t have to brew the most amazing coffee if your customers know the coffee will always be hot.
    - Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.

> "Do what you love until you love to Do" I often think about the “Read what you love until you love to read” comment from @naval, and this is a good generalization. My experience has been that it is easier to educate a Do-er than to motivate the educated; you have to believe you can Do before you embark on an effort. – John Carmack

In terms of task management software, I can't recommend [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) enough (macOS and iOS only). It is a delightful piece of software that gets out of the way and lets you focus on your tasks.

  - With constant innovation, new market entrants and potential black swans like a global pandemic, the best a leader can do is set a 12–18 month strategic plan that is directionally aligned with the company’s true north. That plan should be broken down by quarter with the assumption that the degree of confidence in achieving goals within each quarter will decline over time.
  - Expect each team across the organization to cascade their operational roadmaps from these strategic foci. Operational roadmaps should identify key initiatives and milestones.

  - Rocks: Beware: “Maximizing impact” is harder than you think
  - Execs decide, but ideally PMs are in command
  - Sand maximizes Throughput
  - Beware: Administrative overhead destroys throughput
  - Sand: Prioritize with intuition and desire, not math and metrics
  - Self-managed teams schedule their own Sand

### Project management

- 📖 [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) by Frederick Brooks is a classical book about software project management.
    - Now I do not think software managers have less inherent courage and firmness than chefs, nor than other engineering managers. But false scheduling to match the patron's desired date is much more common in our discipline than elsewhere in engineering.
    - The boss must first distinguish between action information and status information. He must discipline himself not to act on problems his managers can solve.
- Jason Yip, [It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html): standup are a pretty controversial topics.

    - Deadlines set wrong expectations for what's good
    - People are going to cut corners if you put them to tough deadlines.
    - No one is going to experiment with new ways of doing things if you fetishize finishing under deadlines. We'd still be doing MVC in frontend apps if someone at Facebook didn't miss a deadline.
    - Have deadlines, but fuzzy. How fuzzy should be decided by your goals. If missing a deadline could potentially lose you a million dollars, the fuzziness factor for that should be zero.

  - The primary motivator is mission and purpose. Software development is about delivering utility to humanity.
  - The soul is what motivates. You need to be able to explain the "why".

- [Polyglot programming in startup environments](https://medium.com/@FarisZacina/polyglot-startup-environments-1211b93615d5)
    - Never introduce a new programming language in an existing code-base because of personal preference. Building software is a team effort. Globalize your code languages. Team cohesion is what matters the most.
    - You must have production experience in the programming language you want to replace or complement with another one
    - A decision to introduce a new programming language must be based on non-functional requirements, measurements or other relevant arguments, and not personal opinions.
    - Always think about the team and company, and especially about hiring and expanding the team.
    - A programming language is just a tool to deliver software. Don’t be in a tight relationship with your screwdriver.

### Strategy

Shameless plug here, two presentations I contributed to:

- 🎤 [Amazon: the hidden empire](http://www.slideshare.net/faberNovel/amazoncom-the-hidden-empire)
- 🎤 [Apple: 8 easy steps to beat Microsoft](http://www.slideshare.net/faberNovel/apple-study-8-easy-steps-to-beat-microsoft-and-google)
- [Michael Porter's generic strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter%27s_generic_strategies) (Wikipedia)
- [Steve Jobs explaining why you should start from the customers, and go backward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-tKLISfPE) (video 🎞). He makes the point that stopping the OpenDoc project was the right thing to do because it was a technology without any customer.
- [Can Do Vs Must Do](http://avc.com/2017/05/can-do-vs-must-do/) , AVC. "Doing a startup is like playing a video game. Each level requires you to master one thing and once you do that, you level up and then there is a new thing to master."
- "Waterline principle" from Bill Gore: "Think of being on a ship, and imagine that any decision gone bad will blow a hole in the side of the ship. If you blow a hole above the waterline (where the ship won’t take on water and possibly sink), you can patch the hole, learn from the experience, and sail on. But if you blow a hole below the waterline, you can find yourself facing gushers of water pouring in, pulling you toward the ocean floor. And if it’s a big enough hole, you might go down really fast, just like some of the financial firm catastrophes of 2008. To be clear, great enterprises do make big bets, but they avoid big bets that could blow holes below the waterline.", How We Might Fall.
- [Write five, then synthesize: good engineering strategy is boring](https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/), Will Larson.

### Team dynamics

- [Shields Down](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/), Rands in Repose
  - Boredom in its many forms is a major contributor to resignations, but the truth is the list of contributing factors to shield weakening is immense.
  - Every moment as a leader is an opportunity to either strengthen or weaken shields.

### Training

- [Great developers are raised, not hired](https://sizovs.net/2019/04/10/the-best-developers-are-raised-not-hired/)
  - Take some money, energy, time that you spend on recruiting and invest it in teaching your best developers mentoring skills.
  - Adjust your interview process and give a chance to candidates that are not good enough yet, but are eager to learn and have a growth mindset.
  - Relax “hard requirements” in your job ads to avoid filtering out impostors.
- [“Sharing Interesting Stuff”: A simple yet powerful management tool](https://medium.com/shipup-blog/sharing-interesting-stuff-a-simple-yet-powerful-management-tool-771d3c2b39b7)
  - Your direct report sends you something they consider worth sharing with you (can be a blog post, book chapter, video, podcast…) and a few related questions they have in mind a few days before you meet together.
  - On the D day, you share your opinion about it and try to answer the questions that go with it.
  - You switch roles for the next session.
- [Introduce Team G Morning Learning Sessions to Coach the Growth Mindset](https://philippe.bourgau.net/growth-mindset-coaching-turn-remote-work-commutes-into-team-learning/)
  - Meet every morning for 30 minutes. Spend 20 minutes studying and 10 minutes sharing what you have learned.
- [Your Startup’s Management Training Probably Sucks — Here’s How to Make it Better](https://review.firstround.com/your-startups-management-training-probably-sucks-heres-how-to-make-it-better), First Round Review
  - People often think they don’t like management training. But what they’re really saying is “I don’t like shitty management training.”
  - Mistake: only training new managers
  - Snacks are good for the kitchen. They’re less useful for leadership lessons.
  - 4 topics every manager training should include:
    - Goal setting
    - Talent management
    - Org planning
    - Leadership & culture development

### Trust

> The best new ideas always have unanticipated benefits. So it's stupid to require people who want to do new things to enumerate the benefits beforehand. The best you can do is choose smart people and then trust their intuitions about what's worth exploring.

### Work ethics & work/life balance

- [The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/06/the-virtues-of-laziness-and-impatience.html): "there are two areas I encourage you to practice showing, right now: figuring out what’s important, and going home."
- [Lazy Leadership](https://medium.com/the-modern-team/lazy-leadership-8ba19e34f959#.bwcfjz5ac): "entrepreneurship is really just a fancy word for delegation".

- Paul Graham, [How to Write Usefully](http://paulgraham.com/useful.html)
  - Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn't already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.
  - Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write a bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.
  - Importance + novelty + correctness + strength, is the recipe for a good essay
- [Encouraging a Culture of Written Communication](https://www.mcls.io/blog/encouraging-a-culture-of-written-communication)
  - Easy to Search. Single Source of Truth.
  - Balancing Async and Synchronous Communication
  - Thinking Out Loud

  - Do planning before building something new.
  - If everyone agrees how the project should be done then writing the approach down should be a piece of cake.
  - The type of information pushed to people in an organization shapes the culture considerably.

  - If you want to design something attractive, you have to add an axis to your creative process. You have to make the ideas simple and universal at the same time.

### TV Shows

Netflix's [Chef's table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table) profiles a couple world-renown chef. The kitchen world bears a lot of similarities with management. In the season two, I especially recommend episode 1 and 3:

- [Alex Atala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Atala)'s story shows that you need to constantly reinvent and disrupt yourself.
- [Dominique Crenn](http://www.ateliercrenn.com/) explains how she was given ownership over her work in her first kitchen experience (where she was basically given just a dish name, a list of ingredients, and was expected to invent the recipe with no kitchen training). She replicated that in her own kitchen.

The Office is a great satire of a dysfunctioning office.

## Keeping up-to-date: blogs and newsletters

Here are some blogs and newsletter I follow.

### Newsletter

- [Software Lead Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/) (Oren Ellenbogen): a short curation of great management articles. Also include some videos, and some less serious, funny material. A lot of the links founds in this repo appeared in Oren's weekly email.

### Blogs

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): mandatory if you want to stay abreast of what's going in tech. There are some good management articles from time to time as well. Since it can be a pretty huge time sink, I subscribe to a curation of the top articles instead ([RSS feed here](http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/index.rss)).

### Podcast

- [FRICTION with Bob Sutton](https://art19.com/shows/friction-with-bob-sutton?page=3). This podcast does not have any new episode since 2017, but it has some really great content. Great conversations. Lots of stories.
    - Part organizational design. Part therapy. Organizational psychologist and Stanford Professor Bob Sutton is back to tackle friction, the phenomenon that frustrates employees, fatigues teams and causes organizations to flounder and fail.
