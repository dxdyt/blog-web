Uncloud is a lightweight clustering and container orchestration tool that lets you deploy and manage web apps across
cloud VMs and bare metal with minimised cluster management overhead. It creates a secure WireGuard mesh network between
your Docker hosts and provides automatic service discovery, load balancing, ingress with HTTPS, and simple CLI commands
to manage your apps.

Unlike traditional orchestrators, there's no central control plane and quorum to maintain. Each machine maintains a
synchronised copy of the cluster state through peer-to-peer communication, keeping cluster operations functional even if
some machines go offline.

Uncloud is the solution for developers who want the flexibility of self-hosted infrastructure without the operational
complexity of Kubernetes.

## ✨ Features

* **Deploy anywhere**: Combine cloud VMs, dedicated servers, and bare metal into a unified computing environment,
  regardless of location or provider.
* **Docker Compose**: Familiar [Docker Compose](https://compose-spec.io/) format for defining services and volumes. No
  need to learn a new bespoke DSL.
* **Zero-downtime deployments**: Rolling updates without service interruption. Automatic rollback on failure is coming
  soon.
* **[Unregistry](https://github.com/psviderski/unregistry) integration**: Build and push your Docker images directly to
  your machines without an external registry. It will transfer only the missing layers, making it fast and efficient.
* **Service discovery**: Built-in DNS server resolves service names to container IPs.
* **Persistent storage**: Run stateful services with Docker volumes managed across machines.
* **Zero-config private network**: Automatic WireGuard mesh with peer discovery and NAT traversal. Containers get unique
  IPs for direct cross-machine communication.
* **No control plane**: Fully decentralised design eliminates single points of failure and reduces operational overhead.
* **Imperative over declarative**: Favoring imperative operations over state reconciliation simplifies both the mental
  model and troubleshooting.
* **Managed DNS**: Automatic DNS records `*.<id>.cluster.uncloud.run` for services with public access via managed
  [Uncloud DNS](https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud-dns) service.
* **Automatic HTTPS**: Built-in Caddy reverse proxy handles TLS certificate provisioning and renewal using Let's
  Encrypt.
* **Docker-like CLI**: Familiar commands for managing both infrastructure and applications.
* **Remote management**: Control your entire infrastructure through SSH access to any single machine in the cluster.

## 🎬 Quick demo

The screenshot below demonstrates how I use Uncloud to deploy https://uncloud.run website to 2 remote machines from
the [`compose.yaml`](website/compose.yaml) file on my local machine.

It exposes the container port `8000/tcp` as HTTPS on the domain `uncloud.run`, served by the Caddy reverse proxy on the
remote machines. All managed by Uncloud.

Here is a more advanced use case. Deploy a highly available web app with automatic HTTPS across multiple regions and
on-premises in just a couple minutes.

## 💫 Why Uncloud?

Modern cloud platforms like Heroku and Render offer amazing developer experiences but at a premium price. Traditional
container orchestrators like Kubernetes provide power and flexibility but require significant operational expertise. I
believe there's a sweet spot in between — a pragmatic solution for the majority of us who aren't running at Google
scale. You should be able to:

* **Own your infrastructure and data**: Whether driven by costs, compliance, or flexibility, run applications on any
  combination of cloud VMs and personal hardware while controlling your data and maintaining the cloud-like experience
  you love.
* **Stay simple as you grow**: Start with a single machine and add more whenever you need without changing your
  workflow. No worrying about highly-available control planes or complex YAML configurations.
* **Build with proven primitives**: Get production-grade networking, deployment primitives, service discovery, load
  balancing, and ingress with HTTPS out of the box without becoming a distributed systems expert.
* **Support sustainable computing** 🌿: Minimise system overhead to maximise resources available for your applications.

Uncloud's goal is to make deployment and management of containerised applications feel as seamless as using a cloud
platform, whether you're running on a $5 VPS, a spare Mac mini, or a rack of bare metal servers.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Install Uncloud CLI:

   ```bash
   brew install psviderski/tap/uncloud

   # or using curl (macOS/Linux)
   curl -fsS https://get.uncloud.run/install.sh | sh
   ```

   See [Installation](https://uncloud.run/docs/getting-started/install-cli) for more options.

2. Initialise your first machine:

   ```bash
   uc machine init root@your-server-ip
   ```

3. Deploy your app from a Docker image and publish its container port 8000 as HTTPS using `app.example.com` domain:

   ```bash
   uc run -p app.example.com:8000/https image/my-app
   ```

4. Create a DNS A record in your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.) that points `app.example.com` to your
   server's IP address. Allow a few minutes for DNS propagation.

   That's it! Your app is now running and accessible at https://app.example.com ✨

5. Clean up when you're done:

   ```bash
   uc ls
   # Copy the service name from the output and run the rm command:
   uc rm my-app-name
   ```

   If you want to fully uninstall Uncloud on a machine, run:

   ```bash
   uncloud-uninstall
   ```

```

1. The CLI SSHs into the machine and installs Docker, the `uncloudd` machine daemon and
   [corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion) service, managed by systemd.
2. Generates a unique WireGuard key pair, allocates a dedicated subnet `10.210.0.0/24` for the machine and its
   containers, and configures `uncloudd` accordingly. All subsequent communication happens with `uncloudd`
   through its gRPC API over SSH.
3. Configures and starts `corrosion`, a CRDT-based distributed SQLite database to share cluster state between machines.
4. Creates a Docker bridge network connected to the WireGuard interface.
5. This machine becomes an entry point for the newly created cluster which is stored in the cluster config under
   `~/.config/uncloud` on your local machine.

```

1. The second machine gets provisioned just like the first. A non-root SSH user will need `sudo` access.
2. Allocates a new subnet `10.210.1.0/24` for the second machine and its containers.
3. Registers the second machine in the cluster state and exchanges WireGuard keys with the first machine.
4. Both machines establish a WireGuard tunnel between each other, allowing Docker containers connected to the bridge
   network to communicate directly across machines.
5. Configures and starts `corrosion` on the second machine to sync the cluster state.
6. The second machine is added as an alternative entry point in the cluster config.
7. If one of the machines goes offline, the other machine can still serve cluster operations.

If one more machine is added, the process repeats with a new subnet. The new machine needs to establish a WireGuard
connection with only one of the existing machines. Other machines will learn about it through the shared cluster state
and automatically establish a WireGuard tunnel with it.

**When you run a service:**

```bash
$ uc run -p app.example.com:8000/https image/my-app

[+] Running service my-app-1b3b (replicated mode) 1/1
 ✔ Container my-app-1b3b-tcex on oracle-vm  Started

my-app-1b3b endpoints:
 • https://app.example.com → :8000
 • https://my-app-1b3b.xuw3xd.cluster.uncloud.run → :8000
```

1. CLI picks a machine to run your container.
2. `uncloudd` that the CLI communicates with uses [`grpc-proxy`](https://github.com/siderolabs/grpc-proxy) to forward
   the request to the target machine to launch a container there.
3. `uncloudd` on the target machine starts the Docker container in the bridge network and stores its info in the
   cluster's distributed state.
4. The container gets a cluster-unique IP address from the bridge network (in the `10.210.X.2-254` range) and becomes
   accessible from other machines in the cluster.
5. Caddy reverse proxy which runs in [`global`](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/deploy.md#mode)
   mode on each machine watches the cluster state for new services and updates its configuration to route traffic to the
   new container.

Look ma, no control plane or master nodes to maintain! Just a simple overlay network and eventually consistent state
sync that lets machines work together. Want to check on things or make changes? Connect to any machine either implicitly
using the CLI or directly over SSH. They all have the complete cluster state and can control everything. It's like each
machine is a full backup of your control plane.

I'm grateful to the following projects that inspired Uncloud's design and implementation:

* [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/) — for proving that even in the declarative era of Kubernetes there is a place for
  simple deployment tools that use imperative commands without complex orchestration. Kamal powers the multi-billion
  dollar company [37signals](https://37signals.com/) where it was created, and that's truly inspiring!
* [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) — for inspiring my vision for what self-hosted infrastructure should feel like, proving that
  developer experience and powerful infrastructure can coexist beautifully.
* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) — for pioneering the vision of decentralised flat mesh networking with an amazing
  user experience that feels like magic.
* [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos)
  and [KubeSpan](https://www.talos.dev/v1.10/talos-guides/network/kubespan/) — for the machine API design using
  [grpc-proxy](https://github.com/siderolabs/grpc-proxy) and for its elegant approach to secure WireGuard-based overlay
  networking with zero configuration.
* [Docker Swarm Classic](https://github.com/docker-archive/classicswarm) and
  [Rancher 1.x](http://rancher-com-website-main-elb-elb-1798790864.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/docs/rancher/v1.6/en/)
  — for showing the power of simplicity and pragmatism in container orchestration and that not every problem needs the
  complexity of Kubernetes.

Special thanks to the [Corrosion](https://github.com/superfly/corrosion) project by Fly.io for providing the distributed
SQLite database used to share Uncloud's cluster state.
