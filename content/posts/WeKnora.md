# 💡 WeKnora - LLM-Powered Document Understanding & Retrieval Framework

## 📌 Overview

[**WeKnora**](https://weknora.weixin.qq.com) is an LLM-powered framework designed for deep document understanding and semantic retrieval, especially for handling complex, heterogeneous documents. 

It adopts a modular architecture that combines multimodal preprocessing, semantic vector indexing, intelligent retrieval, and large language model inference. At its core, WeKnora follows the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** paradigm, enabling high-quality, context-aware answers by combining relevant document chunks with model reasoning.

**Website:** https://weknora.weixin.qq.com

## 🔒 Security Notice

**Important:** Starting from v0.1.3, WeKnora includes login authentication functionality to enhance system security. For production deployments, we strongly recommend:

- Deploy WeKnora services in internal/private network environments rather than public internet
- Avoid exposing the service directly to public networks to prevent potential information leakage
- Configure proper firewall rules and access controls for your deployment environment
- Regularly update to the latest version for security patches and improvements

## 🏗️ Architecture

![weknora-pipeline.png](./docs/images/pipeline.jpg)

### 🔗 Access WeKnora via MCP Server

#### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Tencent/WeKnora
```

#### 2️⃣ Configure MCP Server
> It is recommended to directly refer to the [MCP Configuration Guide](./mcp-server/MCP_CONFIG.md) for configuration.

Configure the MCP client to connect to the server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weknora": {
      "args": [
        "path/to/WeKnora/mcp-server/run_server.py"
      ],
      "command": "python",
      "env":{
        "WEKNORA_API_KEY":"Enter your WeKnora instance, open developer tools, check the request header x-api-key starting with sk",
        "WEKNORA_BASE_URL":"http(s)://your-weknora-address/api/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run directly using stdio command:
```
pip install weknora-mcp-server
python -m weknora-mcp-server
```

## 🔧 Initialization Configuration Guide

To help users quickly configure various models and reduce trial-and-error costs, we've improved the original configuration file initialization method by adding a Web UI interface for model configuration. Before using, please ensure the code is updated to the latest version. The specific steps are as follows:
If this is your first time using this project, you can skip steps ①② and go directly to steps ③④.

### ① Stop the services

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh --stop
```

### ② Clear existing data tables (recommended when no important data exists)

```bash
make clean-db
```

### ③ Compile and start services

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh
```

### ④ Access Web UI

http://localhost

On first access, it will automatically redirect to the initialization configuration page. After configuration is complete, it will automatically redirect to the knowledge base page. Please follow the page instructions to complete model configuration.

![Configuration Page](./docs/images/config.png)

## 📱 Interface Showcase

### Web UI Interface

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Knowledge Upload</b><br/><img src="./docs/images/knowledges.png" alt="Knowledge Upload Interface"></td>
    <td><b>Q&A Entry</b><br/><img src="./docs/images/qa.png" alt="Q&A Entry Interface"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Rich Text & Image Responses</b><br/><img src="./docs/images/answer.png" alt="Rich Answer Interface"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Knowledge Base Management:** Support for dragging and dropping various documents, automatically identifying document structures and extracting core knowledge to establish indexes. The system clearly displays processing progress and document status, achieving efficient knowledge base management.

### Document Knowledge Graph

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/graph2.png" alt="Knowledge Graph View 1"></td>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/graph1.png" alt="Knowledge Graph View 2"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

WeKnora supports transforming documents into knowledge graphs, displaying the relationships between different sections of the documents. Once the knowledge graph feature is enabled, the system analyzes and constructs an internal semantic association network that not only helps users understand document content but also provides structured support for indexing and retrieval, enhancing the relevance and breadth of search results.
