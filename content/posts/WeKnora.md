# 💡 WeKnora - LLM-Powered Document Understanding & Retrieval Framework

## 📌 Overview

[**WeKnora**](https://weknora.weixin.qq.com) is an LLM-powered framework designed for deep document understanding and semantic retrieval, especially for handling complex, heterogeneous documents. 

It adopts a modular architecture that combines multimodal preprocessing, semantic vector indexing, intelligent retrieval, and large language model inference. At its core, WeKnora follows the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** paradigm, enabling high-quality, context-aware answers by combining relevant document chunks with model reasoning.

**Website:** https://weknora.weixin.qq.com

```

#### 2️⃣ Configure MCP Server
> It is recommended to directly refer to the [MCP Configuration Guide](./mcp-server/MCP_CONFIG.md) for configuration.

Configure the MCP client to connect to the server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weknora": {
      "args": [
        "path/to/WeKnora/mcp-server/run_server.py"
      ],
      "command": "python",
      "env":{
        "WEKNORA_API_KEY":"Enter your WeKnora instance, open developer tools, check the request header x-api-key starting with sk",
        "WEKNORA_BASE_URL":"http(s)://your-weknora-address/api/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run directly using stdio command:
```
pip install weknora-mcp-server
python -m weknora-mcp-server
```

## 🔧 Initialization Configuration Guide

To help users quickly configure various models and reduce trial-and-error costs, we've improved the original configuration file initialization method by adding a Web UI interface for model configuration. Before using, please ensure the code is updated to the latest version. The specific steps are as follows:
If this is your first time using this project, you can skip steps ①② and go directly to steps ③④.

### ① Stop the services

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh --stop
```

### ② Clear existing data tables (recommended when no important data exists)

```bash
make clean-db
```

### ③ Compile and start services

```bash
./scripts/start_all.sh
```

### ④ Access Web UI

http://localhost

On your first visit, you will be automatically redirected to the registration/login page. After completing registration, please create a new knowledge base and finish the relevant settings on its configuration page.

## 📱 Interface Showcase

### Web UI Interface

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Knowledge Base Management</b><br/><img src="./docs/images/knowledgebases.png" alt="Knowledge Base Management"></td>
    <td><b>Conversation Settings</b><br/><img src="./docs/images/settings.png" alt="Conversation Settings"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Agent Mode Tool Call Process</b><br/><img src="./docs/images/agent-qa.png" alt="Agent Mode Tool Call Process"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Knowledge Base Management:** Support for creating FAQ and document knowledge base types, with multiple import methods including drag-and-drop, folder import, and URL import. Automatically identifies document structures and extracts core knowledge to establish indexes. Supports tag management and online entry. The system clearly displays processing progress and document status, achieving efficient knowledge base management.

**Agent Mode:** Support for ReACT Agent mode that can use built-in tools to retrieve knowledge bases, call user-configured MCP tools and web search tools to access external services, providing comprehensive summary reports through multiple iterations and reflection. Supports cross-knowledge base retrieval, allowing selection of multiple knowledge bases for simultaneous retrieval.

**Conversation Strategy:** Support for configuring Agent models, normal mode models, retrieval thresholds, and online Prompt configuration, with precise control over multi-turn conversation behavior and retrieval execution methods. The conversation input box supports Agent mode/normal mode switching, enabling/disabling web search, and selecting conversation models.

### Document Knowledge Graph

WeKnora supports transforming documents into knowledge graphs, displaying the relationships between different sections of the documents. Once the knowledge graph feature is enabled, the system analyzes and constructs an internal semantic association network that not only helps users understand document content but also provides structured support for indexing and retrieval, enhancing the relevance and breadth of search results.

For detailed configuration, please refer to the [Knowledge Graph Configuration Guide](./docs/KnowledgeGraph.md).

### MCP Server

Please refer to the [MCP Configuration Guide](./mcp-server/MCP_CONFIG.md) for the necessary setup.

## 🧭 Developer Guide

### ⚡ Fast Development Mode (Recommended)

If you need to frequently modify code, **you don't need to rebuild Docker images every time**! Use fast development mode:

```bash
# Method 1: Using Make commands (Recommended)
make dev-start      # Start infrastructure
make dev-app        # Start backend (new terminal)
make dev-frontend   # Start frontend (new terminal)

# Method 2: One-click start
./scripts/quick-dev.sh

# Method 3: Using scripts
./scripts/dev.sh start     # Start infrastructure
./scripts/dev.sh app       # Start backend (new terminal)
./scripts/dev.sh frontend  # Start frontend (new terminal)
```

**Development Advantages:**
- ✅ Frontend modifications auto hot-reload (no restart needed)
- ✅ Backend modifications quick restart (5-10 seconds, supports Air hot-reload)
- ✅ No need to rebuild Docker images
- ✅ Support IDE breakpoint debugging
