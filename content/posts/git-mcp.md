## 🤔 What is GitMCP?
**Stop vibe-hallucinating and start vibe-coding!**

[GitMCP](https://gitmcp.io) is a free, open-source, remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp) server that transforms **any** GitHub project (repositories or GitHub pages) into a documentation hub. It enables AI tools like Cursor to access up-to-date documentation and code, even if the LLM has never encountered them, thereby eliminating code hallucinations seamlessly.

GitMCP supports **two flavors** -

*   **Specific Repository (`gitmcp.io/{owner}/{repo}` or `{owner}.gitmcp.io/{repo}`):** Use these when you primarily work with a select number of libraries. This ensures your AI assistant always targets the correct project, enhancing security and relevance by preventing access to unintended repositories.
*   **Generic Server (`gitmcp.io/docs`):** Use this for maximum flexibility when you need to switch between different repositories frequently. The AI assistant will prompt you (or decide based on context) which repository to access for each request. Be mindful that this relies on correctly identifying the target repository each time.

**With GitMCP:**

*   AI assistants access the *latest* documentation and code directly from the source.
*   Get accurate API usage and reliable code examples.
*   Work effectively even with niche, new, or rapidly changing libraries.
*   Significantly reduced hallucinations and improved code correctness.

For example, this side-by-side comparison shows the result for the same one-shot prompt in Cursor when creating a [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) scene -

## 🚀 Getting Started

Using GitMCP is easy! Simply follow these steps:

### Step 1: Choose the type of server you want

Choose one of these URL formats depending on what you want to connect to:

- For GitHub repositories: `gitmcp.io/{owner}/{repo}`
- For GitHub Pages sites: `{owner}.gitmcp.io/{repo}`
- For a generic tool that supports any repository (dynamic): `gitmcp.io/docs`

Replace `{owner}` with the GitHub username or organization name, and `{repo}` with the repository name.

For your convenience, you can also use the conversion tool on the landing page to format the GitHub URL into an MCP URL!

## ⚙ How It Works

GitMCP connects your AI assistant to GitHub repositories using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI tools request additional information from external sources.

What happens when you use GitMCP:

1. **You provide the GitMCP URL** to your AI assistant (e.g., `gitmcp.io/microsoft/typescript`). GitMCP exposes tools like documentation fetching, smart search, code search, etc.
2. **Prompt the AI assistant** on documentation/code-related questions.
3. **Your AI sends requests** to GitMCP to use its tools (with your approval).
4. **GitMCP executes the AI's request** and returns the requested data.
5. **Your AI receives the information** and generates a more accurate, grounded response without hallucinations.

### Supported Documentation

GitMCP currently supports the following documents (in order of priority):
1. [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org)
2. AI-optimized version of the project's documentation
3. `README.md`/root

## 💡 Examples

Here are some examples of how to use GitMCP with different AI assistants and repositories:

### Example 1: Using Windsurf with a specific repository

For the GitHub repository `https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp`, add `https://gitmcp.io/microsoft/playwright-mcp` as an MCP server to Windsurf.

**Prompt to Claude:**
> "How do I use the Playwright MCP"

Windsurf will pull the relevant documentation from GitMCP to implement the memory feature correctly.

### Example 2: Using Cursor with a GitHub Pages site

For the GitHub Pages site `langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph`, add `https://langchain-ai.gitmcp.io/langgraph` as an MCP server to Cursor.

**Prompt to Cursor:**
> "Add memory to my LangGraph agent"

Cursor will pull the relevant documentation and code from GitMCP to correctly implement the memory feature.

### Example 3: Using Claude Desktop with the dynamic endpoint

You don't have to pick specific repositories. The generic `gitmcp.io/docs` endpoint allows AI to pick the GitHub project on the fly!

**Prompt to any AI assistant:**
> "I want to learn about the OpenAI Whisper speech recognition model. Explain how it works.

Claude will pull the data from GitMCP and answer the question.

## 🛠️ Tools

GitMCP provides AI assistants with several valuable tools to help them access, understand, and query GitHub repositories.

### `fetch_<repo-name>_documentation`

This tool gets the primary documentation from a GitHub repository. It works by retrieving relevant documentation (e.g., `llms.txt`). This gives the AI a good overview of what the project is about

**When it's useful:** For general questions about a project's purpose, features, or how to get started

### `search_<repo-name>_documentation`

This tool lets the AI search through a repository's documentation by providing a specific search query. Instead of loading all the documentation (which could be very large), it uses intelligent search to find just the relevant parts.

**When it's useful:** For specific questions about particular features, functions, or concepts within a project

### `fetch_url_content`

This tool helps the AI get information from links mentioned in the documentation. It retrieves the content from those links and converts it to a format the AI can easily read.

**When it's useful:** When documentation references external information that would help answer your question

### `search_<repo-name>_code`

This tool searches through the actual code in the repository using GitHub's code search. It helps AI find specific code examples or implementation details.

**When it's useful:** When you want examples of how something is implemented or need technical details not covered in documentation

> **Note:** When using the dynamic endpoint (`gitmcp.io/docs`), these tools are named slightly differently (`fetch_generic_documentation`, `search_generic_code`, and `search_generic_documentation`) and need additional information about which repository to access.

## 📊 Badge

GitMCP has a badge to your repository's README. It allows users to quickly access your documentation through their IDE or browser (using the embedded chat). It also showcases how many times your documentation has been accessed through GitMCP.

Example (`idosal/git-mcp`): [![GitMCP](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gitmcp.io/badge/idosal/git-mcp)](https://gitmcp.io/idosal/git-mcp)

### Adding the Badge to Your Repository

Add the following to your `README.md`:

```markdown
[![GitMCP](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gitmcp.io/badge/OWNER/REPO)](https://gitmcp.io/OWNER/REPO)
```

Replace `OWNER` with your GitHub username or organization, and `REPO` with your repository name.

### How We Count Views

Increment for each tool call on the specific repository.

### Customizing the Badge

You can customize the badge's appearance with parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `color` | Color for the badge value | `aquamarine` | `?color=green` |
| `label` | Badge label | `GitMCP` | `Documentation`
