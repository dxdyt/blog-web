**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

![architecture](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/202cb7e51e218c7b29eb3b11ad058bd56b7739de/etc/dbt-transform.png)

## Understanding dbt

Analysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse.

These select statements, or "models", form a dbt project. Models frequently build on top of one another â€“ dbt makes it easy to [manage relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/ref) between models, and [visualize these relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation), as well as assure the quality of your transformations through [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing).
