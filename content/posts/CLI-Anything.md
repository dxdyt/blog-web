## 🤔 Why CLI?

CLI is the universal interface for both humans and AI agents:

• **Structured & Composable** - Text commands match LLM format and chain for complex workflows

• **Lightweight & Universal** - Minimal overhead, works across all systems without dependencies

• **Self-Describing** - --help flags provide automatic documentation agents can discover

• **Proven Success** - Claude Code runs thousands of real workflows through CLI daily

• **Agent-First Design** - Structured JSON output eliminates parsing complexity

• **Deterministic & Reliable** - Consistent results enable predictable agent behavior

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- Target software installed (e.g., GIMP, Blender, LibreOffice, or your own application)
- A supported AI coding agent: [Claude Code](#-claude-code) | [Pi](#-pi-coding-agent) | [OpenClaw](#-openclaw) | [OpenCode](#-opencode) | [Codex](#-codex) | [Qodercli](#-qodercli) | [GitHub Copilot CLI](#-github-copilot-cli) | [More Platforms](#-more-platforms-coming-soon)

### Pick Your Platform

<details open>
<summary><h4 id="-claude-code">⚡ Claude Code</h4></summary>

**Step 1: Add the Marketplace**

CLI-Anything is distributed as a Claude Code plugin marketplace hosted on GitHub.

```bash
# Add the CLI-Anything marketplace
/plugin marketplace add HKUDS/CLI-Anything
```

**Step 2: Install the Plugin**

```bash
# Install the cli-anything plugin from the marketplace
/plugin install cli-anything
```

That's it. The plugin is now available in your Claude Code session.

> **Note for Win Users:** Claude Code runs shell commands via `bash`. On Windows, install Git for Windows (includes `bash` and
`cygpath`) or use WSL; otherwise commands may fail with `cygpath: command not found`.

**Step 3: Build a CLI in One Command**

```bash
# /cli-anything <software-path-or-repo>
# Generate a complete CLI for GIMP (all 7 phases)
/cli-anything ./gimp
```

Command compatibility across Claude Code versions:
- Use `/cli-anything` as the primary entrypoint.
- On older builds where `/cli-anything` isn't recognized **after confirming the plugin is installed and loaded**, try the legacy entry form `/cli-anything:cli-anything`.
- Auxiliary commands keep the `:subcommand` form (e.g. `/cli-anything:refine`).

If you see `Unknown skill: cli-anything`, focus on plugin install/load first (both entry forms reference the same skill, so swapping forms won't help):
1. Reload plugin commands: `/reload-plugins`
2. Verify the plugin is loaded: `/help cli-anything` (CLI-Anything help/commands should appear)
3. Reinstall from marketplace if needed:
   - `/plugin marketplace add HKUDS/CLI-Anything`
   - `/plugin install cli-anything`
4. After confirming the plugin is available, retry the entry command:
   - Preferred: `/cli-anything ./gimp`
   - Older builds only: `/cli-anything:cli-anything ./gimp`

This runs the full pipeline:
1. 🔍 **Analyze** — Scans source code, maps GUI actions to APIs
2. 📐 **Design** — Architects command groups, state model, output formats
3. 🔨 **Implement** — Builds Click CLI with REPL, JSON output, undo/redo
4. 📋 **Plan Tests** — Creates TEST.md with unit + E2E test plans
5. 🧪 **Write Tests** — Implements comprehensive test suite
6. 📝 **Document** — Updates TEST.md with results
7. 📦 **Publish** — Creates `setup.py`, installs to PATH

**Step 4 (Optional): Refine and Improve the CLI**

After the initial build, you can iteratively refine the CLI to expand coverage and add missing capabilities:

```bash
# Broad refinement — agent analyzes gaps across all capabilities
/cli-anything:refine ./gimp

# Focused refinement — target a specific functionality area
/cli-anything:refine ./gimp "I want more CLIs on image batch processing and filters"
```

The refine command performs gap analysis between the software's full capabilities and current CLI coverage, then implements new commands, tests, and documentation for the identified gaps. You can run it multiple times to steadily expand coverage — each run is incremental and non-destructive.

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative: Manual Installation</strong></summary>

If you prefer not to use the marketplace:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git

# Copy plugin to Claude Code plugins directory
cp -r CLI-Anything/cli-anything-plugin ~/.claude/plugins/cli-anything

# Reload plugins
/reload-plugins
```

</details>

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4 id="-pi-coding-agent">⚡ Pi Coding Agent</h4></summary>

**Step 1: Install the Extension**

The extension lives at `.pi-extension/cli-anything/` in this repository. Install it globally so `/cli-anything` commands are available in **all** Pi projects:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git
cd CLI-Anything

# Install globally into Pi's extensions directory
bash .pi-extension/cli-anything/install.sh
```

To uninstall:

```bash
bash .pi-extension/cli-anything/install.sh --uninstall
```

> **How it works:** `install.sh` copies the extension files (including HARNESS.md, commands, guides, scripts, and templates from `cli-anything-plugin/`) into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/cli-anything/`, which Pi auto-discovers on startup. Run `/reload` in Pi or restart Pi to activate.

**Step 2: Build a CLI in One Command**

Once the extension is loaded, the following commands are available:

```bash
# Generate a complete CLI for GIMP (all 7 phases)
/cli-anything ./gimp

# Build from a GitHub repo
/cli-anything https://github.com/blender/blender
```

**Step 3 (Optional): Refine and Improve the CLI**

```bash
# Broad refinement — agent analyzes gaps across all capabilities
/cli-anything:refine ./gimp

# Focused refinement — target a specific functionality area
/cli-anything:refine ./gimp "batch processing and filters"
```

**Available Commands**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cli-anything <path-or-repo>` | Build a complete CLI harness |
| `/cli-anything:refine <path> [focus]` | Refine an existing CLI harness |
| `/cli-anything:test <path-or-repo>` | Run tests for a CLI harness |
| `/cli-anything:validate <path-or-repo>` | Validate a CLI harness |
| `/cli-anything:list [options]` | List all CLI-Anything tools |

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4 id="-opencode">⚡ OpenCode (Experimental)</h4></summary>

**Step 1: Install the Commands**

> **Note:** Please upgrade to the latest OpenCode. Older versions may use a different commands path.

Copy the CLI-Anything commands **and** `HARNESS.md` to your OpenCode commands directory:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git

# Global install (available in all projects)
cp CLI-Anything/opencode-commands/*.md ~/.config/opencode/commands/
cp CLI-Anything/cli-anything-plugin/HARNESS.md ~/.config/opencode/commands/

# Or project-level install
cp CLI-Anything/opencode-commands/*.md .opencode/commands/
cp CLI-Anything/cli-anything-plugin/HARNESS.md .opencode/commands/
```

> **Note:** Please upgrade to the latest OpenCode. Older versions use `command/` (singular) instead of `commands/`. If `commands/` does not exist, use `command/` for both global and project-level installs.

> **Note:** `HARNESS.md` is the methodology spec that all commands reference. It must be in the same directory as the commands.

This adds 5 slash commands: `/cli-anything`, `/cli-anything-refine`, `/cli-anything-test`, `/cli-anything-validate`, and `/cli-anything-list`.

**Step 2: Build a CLI in One Command**

```bash
# Generate a complete CLI for GIMP (all 7 phases)
/cli-anything ./gimp

# Build from a GitHub repo
/cli-anything https://github.com/blender/blender
```

The command runs as a subtask and follows the same 7-phase methodology as Claude Code.

**Step 3 (Optional): Refine and Improve the CLI**

```bash
# Broad refinement — agent analyzes gaps across all capabilities
/cli-anything-refine ./gimp

# Focused refinement — target a specific functionality area
/cli-anything-refine ./gimp "batch processing and filters"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4 id="-goose">⚡ Goose (Desktop / CLI) <sup><code>Experimental</code></sup> <sup><code>Community</code></sup></h4></summary>

**Step 1: Install Goose**

Install Goose (Desktop or CLI) using the official Goose instructions for your OS.

**Step 2: Configure a CLI Provider**

Configure Goose to use a CLI provider such as Claude Code, and make sure that CLI is installed and authenticated.

**Step 3: Use CLI-Anything in a Goose Session**

Once Goose is configured, start a session and use the same CLI-Anything commands described above for Claude Code, for example:

```bash
/cli-anything ./gimp
/cli-anything:refine ./gimp "batch processing and filters"
```

> Note: When Goose runs through a CLI provider, it uses that provider's capabilities and command format.
</details>

<details>

<summary><h4 id="-qodercli">⚡ Qodercli <sup><code>Community</code></sup></h4></summary>

**Step 1: Register the Plugin**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git
bash CLI-Anything/qoder-plugin/setup-qodercli.sh
```

This registers the cli-anything plugin in `~/.qoder.json`. Start a new Qodercli session after registration.

**Step 2: Use CLI-Anything from Qodercli**

```bash
/cli-anything ./gimp
/cli-anything:refine ./gimp "batch processing and filters"
/cli-anything:validate ./gimp
```
</details>

<details>

<summary><h4 id="-openclaw">⚡ OpenClaw <sup><code>Community</code></sup></h4></summary>

**Step 1: Install the Skill**

CLI-Anything provides a native OpenClaw `SKILL.md` file. Copy it to your OpenClaw skills directory:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git

# Install to the global skills folder
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/cli-anything
cp CLI-Anything/openclaw-skill/SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/skills/cli-anything/SKILL.md
```

**Step 2: Build a CLI**

Now you can invoke the skill inside OpenClaw:

`@cli-anything build a CLI for ./gimp`

The skill follows the same 7-phase methodology as Claude Code and OpenCode.

</details>

<details>

<summary><h4 id="-codex">⚡ Codex <sup><code>Experimental</code></sup> <sup><code>Community</code></sup></h4></summary>

**Step 1: Install the Skill**

Run the bundled installer:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git

# Install the skill
bash CLI-Anything/codex-skill/scripts/install.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell, use:

```powershell
.\CLI-Anything\codex-skill\scripts\install.ps1
```

This installs the skill to `$CODEX_HOME/skills/cli-anything` (or `~/.codex/skills/cli-anything` if `CODEX_HOME` is unset).

Restart Codex after installation so it is discovered.

**Step 2: Use CLI-Anything from Codex**

Describe the task in natural language, for example:

```text
Use CLI-Anything to build a harness for ./gimp
Use CLI-Anything to refine ./shotcut for picture-in-picture workflows
Use CLI-Anything to validate ./libreoffice
```

The Codex skill adapts the same methodology used by the Claude Code plugin and
OpenCode commands, while keeping the generated Python harness format unchanged.
</details>

<details>

<summary><h4 id="-github-copilot-cli">⚡ GitHub Copilot CLI <sup><code>Community</code></sup></h4></summary>

**Step 1: Install the Plugin**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything.git
cd CLI-Anything
copilot plugin install ./cli-anything-plugin
```

This installs the CLI-Anything plugin to GitHub Copilot CLI. The plugin should now be available in your GitHub Copilot CLI session.

**Step 2: Use CLI-Anything from GitHub Copilot CLI**

```bash
/cli-anything ./gimp
/cli-anything:refine ./gimp "batch processing and filters"
/cli-anything:validate ./gimp
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4 id="-more-platforms-coming-soon">🔮 More Platforms (Coming Soon)</h4></summary>

CLI-Anything is designed to be platform-agnostic. Support for more AI coding agents is planned:

- **Codex** — available via the bundled skill in `codex-skill/`
- **Cursor** — coming soon
- **Windsurf** — coming soon
- **Your favorite tool** — contributions welcome! See the `opencode-commands/` directory for a reference implementation.

</details>

### Use the Generated CLI

Regardless of which platform you used to build it, the generated CLI works the same way:

```bash
# Install to PATH
cd gimp/agent-harness && pip install -e .

# Use from anywhere
cli-anything-gimp --help
cli-anything-gimp project new --width 1920 --height 1080 -o poster.json
cli-anything-gimp --json layer add -n "Background" --type solid --color "#1a1a2e"

# Enter interactive REPL
cli-anything-gimp
```

Each in-repo harness now has a canonical [`SKILL.md`](#-skillmd-generation) at `skills/cli-anything-<software>/SKILL.md`, which makes the monorepo directly discoverable via `npx skills add HKUDS/CLI-Anything --list`. Installed harness packages still ship a compatibility copy at `cli_anything/<software>/skills/SKILL.md`, and the REPL banner prefers the repo-root canonical file when present, falling back to the packaged copy otherwise.

---

## 🤖 Empower Your Agents with CLI-Hub

CLI-Hub lets agents autonomously discover and install the CLIs they need — zero human intervention required.

We published a **meta-skill** that lets any AI agent freely explore the full catalog of community CLIs and pick the right one for the task.

**Install in one command:**

```bash
# OpenClaw
openclaw skills install cli-anything-hub

# nanobot
nanobot skills install cli-anything-hub
```

**Then just prompt your agent:**

```
Find appropriate CLI software in CLI-Hub and complete the task: <your task here>
```

The agent will browse the catalog, install whichever CLI fits the task, and use it — all autonomously.

**How it works under the hood:**

1. The meta-skill points to the live catalog at [`https://reeceyang.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/SKILL.md`](https://reeceyang.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/SKILL.md)
2. The agent reads 20+ CLIs organized by category with one-line `pip install` commands
3. The agent installs whichever CLI fits the task, then reads that CLI's own SKILL.md for detailed usage

The catalog auto-updates whenever `registry.json` changes — new community CLIs show up automatically.

> **For Claude Code users:** Copy [`skills/cli-hub-meta-skill/SKILL.md`](skills/cli-hub-meta-skill/SKILL.md) into your project or skills directory for the same automatic CLI discovery.

## CLI-Anything's Key Features

### The Agent-Software Gap
AI agents are great at reasoning but terrible at using real professional software. Current solutions are fragile UI automation, limited APIs, or dumbed-down reimplementations that miss 90% of functionality.

**CLI-Anything's Solution**: Transform any professional software into agent-native tools without losing capabilities.

| **Current Pain Point** | **CLI-Anything's Fix** |
|----------|----------------------|
| 🤖 "AI can't use real tools" | Direct integration with actual software backends (Blender, LibreOffice, FFmpeg) — full professional capabilities, zero compromises |
| 💸 "UI automation breaks constantly" | No screenshots, no clicking, no RPA fragility. Pure command-line reliability with structured interfaces |
| 📊 "Agents need structured data" | Built-in JSON output for seamless agent consumption + human-readable formats for debugging |
| 🔧 "Custom integrations are expensive" | One Claude plugin auto-generates CLIs for ANY codebase through proven 7-phase pipeline |
| ⚡ "Prototype vs Production gap" | 2,280+ tests with real software validation. Battle-tested across 18 major applications |

## 🎯 What Can You Do with CLI-Anything?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

### 🛠️ Let Agents Take Your Workflows

Professional or everyday — just throw the codebase at `/cli-anything`. GIMP, Blender, Shotcut for creative work. LibreOffice, OBS Studio for daily tasks. Don't have the source? Find an open-source alternative and throw *that* in. You'll instantly get a full CLI your agents can use.

</td>
<td width="33%">

### 🔗 Unify Scattered APIs into One CLI

Tired of juggling fragmented web service APIs? Feed the docs or SDK manuscripts to `/cli-anything` and your agents get a **powerful, stateful CLI** that wraps those individual endpoints into coherent command groups. One tool instead of dozens of raw API calls — stronger capabilities while saving tokens.

</td>
<td width="33%">

### 🚀 Replace or Supercharge GUI Agents

CLI-Anything can flat-out **replace GUI-based agent approaches** — no more screenshots, no brittle pixel-clicking. But here's the fun part: once you `/cli-anything` a GUI software, you can **synthesize agent tasks, evaluators, and benchmarks** entirely via code and terminal — fully automated, iteratively refinable, massively more efficient.

## ✨ ⚙️ How CLI-Anything Works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🏗️ Fully Automated 7-Phase Pipeline
From codebase analysis to PyPI publishing — the plugin handles architecture design, implementation, test planning, test writing, and documentation completely automatically.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🎯 Authentic Software Integration
Direct calls to real applications for actual rendering. LibreOffice generates PDFs, Blender renders 3D scenes, Audacity processes audio via sox. **Zero compromises**, **Zero toy implementations**.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔁 Smart Session Management
Persistent project state with undo/redo capabilities, plus unified REPL interface (ReplSkin) that delivers consistent interactive experience across all CLIs.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 📦 Zero-Config Installation
Simple pip install -e . puts cli-anything-<software> directly on PATH. Agents discover tools via standard which commands. No setup, no wrappers.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🧪 Production-Grade Testing
Multi-layered validation: unit tests with synthetic data, end-to-end tests with real files and software, plus CLI subprocess verification of installed commands.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🐍 Clean Package Architecture
All CLIs organized under cli_anything.* namespace — conflict-free, pip-installable, with consistent naming: cli-anything-gimp, cli-anything-blender, etc.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 🤖 SKILL.md Generation

Each generated CLI now has a canonical `SKILL.md` at `skills/cli-anything-<software>/SKILL.md`. This makes the current monorepo directly consumable by `npx skills`, while a packaged compatibility copy at `cli_anything/<software>/skills/SKILL.md` preserves installed-harness behavior.

**What SKILL.md provides:**
- **YAML frontmatter** with name and description for agent skill discovery
- **Command groups** with all available subcommands documented
- **Usage examples** for common workflows
- **Agent-specific guidance** for JSON output, error handling, and programmatic use

SKILL.md files are auto-generated during Phase 6.5 of the pipeline using `skill_generator.py`, which extracts metadata directly from the CLI's Click decorators, setup.py, and README. The generator now writes the canonical repo-root skill file and refreshes the package-local compatibility copy used by installed harnesses. Inside this repo, the REPL banner points agents to the canonical root skill path; after `pip install`, it falls back to the packaged copy.

## 🎬 Real-World Demos

AI agents using generated CLIs to produce complete, useful artifacts — no GUI needed.

### FreeCAD &mdash; Curiosity Rover via Preview, Live Preview, and Trajectory

> **Harness:** `cli-anything-freecad` | **Preview Stack:** `preview` + `preview live` + `trajectory.json` | **Artifact:** Agent-built Curiosity-style rover

An agent incrementally assembles a Curiosity-inspired rover while publishing real FreeCAD preview bundles, refreshing a live preview session, and recording command-to-preview history for later replay. The resulting demo shows the artifact evolving step by step before the final showcase.

### Blender &mdash; Orbital Relay Drone via Preview, Live Preview, and Trajectory

> **Harness:** `cli-anything-blender` | **Preview Stack:** `preview` + `preview live` + `trajectory.json` | **Artifact:** Agent-built orbital relay drone

An agent uses the Blender harness to grow a hard-surface orbital relay drone under a real preview loop: each stage pushes new render-backed bundles, the live session tracks the current head, and the trajectory ties every command to the matching visual state. The demo finishes with the completed scene ready for a polished turntable.

## 📊 Test Results

Each CLI harness undergoes rigorous multi-layered testing to ensure production reliability:

| Layer | What it tests | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Unit tests** | Every core function in isolation with synthetic data | `test_core.py` — project creation, layer ops, filter params |
| **E2E tests (native)** | Project file generation pipeline | Valid ODF ZIP structure, correct MLT XML, SVG well-formedness |
| **E2E tests (true backend)** | Real software invocation + output verification | LibreOffice → PDF with `%PDF-` magic bytes, Blender → rendered PNG |
| **CLI subprocess tests** | Installed command via `subprocess.run` | `cli-anything-gimp --json project new` → valid JSON output |

## 🏗️ CLI-Anything's Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="CLI-Anything Architecture" width="750">
</p>

### 🎯 Core Design Principles

1. **Authentic Software Integration** — The CLI generates valid project files (ODF, MLT XML, SVG) and delegates to real applications for rendering. **We build structured interfaces TO software, not replacements**.

2. **Flexible Interaction Models** — Every CLI operates in dual modes: stateful REPL for interactive agent sessions + subcommand interface for scripting/pipelines. **Run bare command → enter REPL mode**.

3. **Consistent User Experience** — All generated CLIs share unified REPL interface (repl_skin.py) with branded banners, styled prompts, command history, progress indicators, and standardized formatting.

4. **Agent-Native Design** — Built-in --json flag on every command delivers structured data for machine consumption, while human-readable tables serve interactive use. **Agents discover capabilities via standard --help and which commands**.

5. **Zero Compromise Dependencies** — Real software is a hard requirement — no fallbacks, no graceful degradation. **Tests fail (not skip) when backends are missing, ensuring authentic functionality**.

## 🎮 Demo: Using a Generated CLI

Here's what an agent can do with `cli-anything-libreoffice`:

```bash
# Create a new Writer document
$ cli-anything-libreoffice document new -o report.json --type writer
✓ Created Writer document: report.json

# Add content
$ cli-anything-libreoffice --project report.json writer add-heading -t "Q1 Report" --level 1
✓ Added heading: "Q1 Report"

$ cli-anything-libreoffice --project report.json writer add-table --rows 4 --cols 3
✓ Added 4×3 table

# Export to real PDF via LibreOffice headless
$ cli-anything-libreoffice --project report.json export render output.pdf -p pdf --overwrite
✓ Exported: output.pdf (42,831 bytes) via libreoffice-headless

# JSON mode for agent consumption
$ cli-anything-libreoffice --json document info --project report.json
{
  "name": "Q1 Report",
  "type": "writer",
  "pages": 1,
  "elements": 2,
  "modified": true
}
```

### REPL Mode

```
$ cli-anything-blender

## 📖 The Standard Playbook: HARNESS.md

HARNESS.md is our definitive SOP for making any software agent-accessible via automated CLI generation.

It encodes proven patterns and methodologies refined through automated generation processes.

The playbook distills key insights from successfully building all 18 diverse, production-ready harnesses.

### Critical Lessons

| Lesson | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Use the real software** | The CLI MUST call the actual application for rendering. No Pillow replacements for GIMP, no custom renderers for Blender. Generate valid project files → invoke the real backend. |
| **The Rendering Gap** | GUI apps apply effects at render time. If your CLI manipulates project files but uses a naive export tool, effects get silently dropped. Solution: native renderer → filter translation → render script. |
| **Filter Translation** | When mapping effects between formats (MLT → ffmpeg), watch for duplicate filter merging, interleaved stream ordering, parameter space differences, and unmappable effects. |
| **Timecode Precision** | Non-integer frame rates (29.97fps) cause cumulative rounding. Use `round()` not `int()`, integer arithmetic for display, and ±1 frame tolerance in tests. |
| **Output Verification** | Never trust that export worked because it exited 0. Verify: magic bytes, ZIP/OOXML structure, pixel analysis, audio RMS levels, duration checks. |

## 📦 Installation & Usage

### For Plugin Users (Claude Code)

```bash
# Add marketplace & install (recommended)
/plugin marketplace add HKUDS/CLI-Anything
/plugin install cli-anything

# Build a CLI for any software with a codebase
/cli-anything <software-name>
```

### For Generated CLIs

```bash
# Install any generated CLI
cd <software>/agent-harness
pip install -e .

# Verify
which cli-anything-<software>

# Use
cli-anything-<software> --help
cli-anything-<software>                    # enters REPL
cli-anything-<software> --json <command>   # JSON output for agents
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests for a specific CLI
cd <software>/agent-harness
python3 -m pytest cli_anything/<software>/tests/ -v

# Force-installed mode (recommended for validation)
CLI_ANYTHING_FORCE_INSTALLED=1 python3 -m pytest cli_anything/<software>/tests/ -v -s
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! CLI-Anything is designed to be extensible:

- **New software targets** — Use the plugin to generate a CLI for any software with a codebase, then submit your harness via [`cli-anything-plugin/PUBLISHING.md`](cli-anything-plugin/PUBLISHING.md).
- **Methodology improvements** — PRs to `HARNESS.md` that encode new lessons learned
- **Plugin enhancements** — New commands, phase improvements, better validation
- **Test coverage** — More E2E scenarios, edge cases, workflow tests

### Limitations

- **Requires strong foundation models** — CLI-Anything relies on frontier-class models (e.g., Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.4) for reliable harness generation. Weaker or smaller models may produce incomplete or incorrect CLIs that require significant manual correction.
- **Relies on available source code** — The 7-phase pipeline analyzes and generates from source code. When the target software only provides compiled binaries that require decompilation, harness quality and coverage will degrade substantially.
- **May require iterative refinement** — A single `/cli-anything` run may not fully cover all capabilities. Running `/refine` one or more times is often needed to push the CLI's performance and coverage to production quality.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Support for more application categories (CAD, DAW, IDE, EDA, scientific tools)
- [ ] Benchmark suite for agent task completion rates
- [ ] Community-contributed CLI harnesses for internal/custom software
- [ ] Integration with additional agent frameworks beyond Claude Code
- [ ] Support packaging APIs for closed-source software and web services into CLIs
- [x] Produce SKILL.md alongside the CLI for agent skill discovery and orchestration
