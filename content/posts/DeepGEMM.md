# DeepGEMM

DeepGEMM is a unified, high-performance tensor core kernel library that brings together the key computation primitives of modern large language models — GEMMs (FP8, FP4, BF16), fused MoE with overlapped communication (Mega MoE), MQA scoring for the lightning indexer, HyperConnection (HC), and more — into a single, cohesive CUDA codebase. All kernels are compiled at runtime via a lightweight Just-In-Time (JIT) module, requiring no CUDA compilation during installation.

DeepGEMM leverages some concepts from [CUTLASS](https://github.com/nvidia/cutlass) and [CuTe](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/include/cute), but avoids heavy reliance on their templates or algebras. The library is designed for simplicity, with only a limited number of core kernel functions, making it a clean and accessible resource for learning NVIDIA GPU kernel optimization techniques.

Despite its lightweight design, DeepGEMM's performance matches or exceeds expert-tuned libraries across various matrix shapes.

cd DeepGEMM

# Link some essential includes and build the CPP JIT module

## Interfaces

#### Notices

This library provides optimized GEMM kernels for NVIDIA GPUs with a naming convention: `D = C + A @ B`. The input shape layout is NT (non-transposed A, transposed B). While the SM90 implementation supports only the NT memory layout (row-major, col-major), the SM100 implementation supports all memory layouts (NT, TN, NN, TT). For example, `fp8_gemm_nt` will do a `D = C + A @ B.T`

For both architectures, the LHS scaling factor is required to have a TMA-aligned and transposed layout. And the data format for the scaling factor of SM90 and SM100 is different:

- SM90 requires scaling factors in FP32 format.
- SM100 requires scaling factors in packed [UE8M0](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#alternate-floating-point-data-formats) format, which packs 4 UE8M0 into a single `torch.int`.

Please note that operations like input transposition or FP8 casting must be handled separately by the user, please implement or fuse them into prior kernels independently. While the library provides some simple PyTorch utility functions, these may result in slower performance, but our primary focus is on optimizing the GEMM kernels themselves.

#### Normal dense GEMMs (non-grouped)

To perform a basic non-grouped FP8 GEMM, call the `fp8_gemm_{nt, nn, tn, tt}` function. For more details, please refer to the function documentation.

#### Grouped GEMMs (contiguous layout)

Unlike traditional grouped GEMMs in CUTLASS, DeepGEMM groups only the M-axis, while N and K must remain fixed. This design is tailored for scenarios where experts in an MoE model share the same shape. For training forward passes or inference prefilling, where each expert may process a varying number of tokens, we concatenate these tokens into a single tensor, referred to as the "contiguous" layout. Note that each expert segment must be aligned to the GEMM M block size (`get_mk_alignment_for_contiguous_layout()`).  For more information, please refer to the `m_grouped_fp8_gemm_{nt, nn}_contiguous` function documentation.

We also provide a K-axis-grouped API for MoE weight backward (with M and N must remain fixed), please refer to `k_grouped_fp8_gemm_tn_contiguous` for more information.

#### Grouped GEMMs (masked layout)

During the inference decoding phase, when CUDA graph is enabled and the CPU is unaware of the number of tokens each expert receives, we support masked grouped GEMMs. By providing a mask tensor, the kernel computes only the valid portions.

Use `m_grouped_fp8_gemm_nt_masked` for this purpose and consult the relevant documentation. An example usage is to use the output of low-latency kernels from [DeepEP](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepEP) as input.

#### V3.2 MQA kernels for the indexer

The kernel family has two versions, non-paged (for prefilling) and paged (for decoding).
Take the non-paged version `fp8_mqa_logits` as an example. It has 6 inputs:

- `q`, E4M3 tensor with shape `[seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]`
- `kv`, E4M3 tensor (shaped as `[seq_len_kv, head_dim]`) with float SF (shaped as `[seq_len_kv]`)
- `weights`, float tensor with shape `[seq_len, num_heads]`
- `cu_seq_len_k_start` and `cu_seq_len_k_end`, int tensor with shape `[seq_len]`
- `clean_logits`, whether to clean the unfilled logits into `-inf`

The output tensor is shaped as `[seq_len, seq_len_kv]`, indicating token-to-token logits.
For each token `i` in `q`, it will iterate all tokens `j` from `[cu_seq_len_k_start[i], cu_seq_len_k_end[i])`,
and calculate the logit `out[i, j]` as:

```python
kv_j = kv[0][j, :] * kv[1][j].unsqueeze(1)  # [head_dim]
out_ij = q[i, :, :] @ kv_j  # [num_heads]
out_ij = out_ij.relu() * weights[i, :]  # [num_heads]
out_ij = out_ij.sum()  # Scalar
```

For more details and the paged version `fp8_paged_mqa_logits`, please refer to `tests/test_attention.py`.

#### Mega MoE

Mega MoE fuses and overlaps EP dispatch, linear 1 (FP8xFP4), SwiGLU, linear 2 (FP8xFP4), and EP combine into a single mega-kernel, overlapping NVLink communication and tensor core computation. It requires multi-process launch with symmetric memory. Usage:

```python
# Allocate symmetric memory buffer
# NOTES: requires PyTorch >= 2.9
buffer = deep_gemm.get_symm_buffer_for_mega_moe(
    group, num_experts, num_max_tokens_per_rank, num_topk, hidden, intermediate_hidden
)

# Transform weights (FP4 with UE8M0 SF) into the required layout
transformed_l1, transformed_l2 = deep_gemm.transform_weights_for_mega_moe(l1_weights, l2_weights)

# Copy inputs into the buffer before each call
# You may fuse these into previous kernels
buffer.x[:num_tokens].copy_(x_fp8)
buffer.x_sf[:num_tokens].copy_(x_sf)
buffer.topk_idx[:num_tokens].copy_(topk_idx)
buffer.topk_weights[:num_tokens].copy_(topk_weights)

# Run the fused mega MoE kernel
y = torch.empty((num_tokens, hidden), dtype=torch.bfloat16, device='cuda')
deep_gemm.fp8_fp4_mega_moe(y, transformed_l1, transformed_l2, buffer)
```

For the full example with multi-process setup and benchmarking, please refer to `tests/test_mega_moe.py`.
