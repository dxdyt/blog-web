2025-09-05: VibeVoice is an open-source research framework intended to advance collaboration in the speech synthesis community. After release, we discovered instances where the tool was used in ways inconsistent with the stated intent. Since responsible use of AI is one of Microsoft’s guiding principles, we have removed the VibeVoice-TTS code from this repository.


2025-08-25: 📣 We open-sourced <a href="docs/vibevoice-tts.md"><strong>VibeVoice-TTS</strong></a>, a long-form multi-speaker text-to-speech model that can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers.

## Overview

VibeVoice is a **family of open-source frontier voice AI models** that includes both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. 

A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of **7.5 Hz**. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a [next-token diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08635) framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.

## Models


### 1. 📖 [VibeVoice-ASR](docs/vibevoice-asr.md) - Long-form Speech Recognition

**VibeVoice-ASR** is a unified speech-to-text model designed to handle **60-minute long-form audio** in a single pass, generating structured transcriptions containing **Who (Speaker), When (Timestamps), and What (Content)**, with support for **Customized Hotwords**.

- **🕒 60-minute Single-Pass Processing**:
  Unlike conventional ASR models that slice audio into short chunks (often losing global context), VibeVoice ASR accepts up to **60 minutes** of continuous audio input within 64K token length. This ensures consistent speaker tracking and semantic coherence across the entire hour.

- **👤 Customized Hotwords**:
  Users can provide customized hotwords (e.g., specific names, technical terms, or background info) to guide the recognition process, significantly improving accuracy on domain-specific content.

- **📝 Rich Transcription (Who, When, What)**:
  The model jointly performs ASR, diarization, and timestamping, producing a structured output that indicates *who* said *what* and *when*.

## ⚠️ Risks and Limitations


While efforts have been made to optimize it through various techniques, it may still produce outputs that are unexpected, biased, or inaccurate. VibeVoice inherits any biases, errors, or omissions produced by its base model (specifically, Qwen2.5 1.5b in this release).
Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content.


We do not recommend using VibeVoice in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. This model is intended for research and development purposes only. Please use responsibly.
