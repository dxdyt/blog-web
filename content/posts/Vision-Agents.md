## Build Real-Time Vision AI Agents

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9778ab9-938d-4101-8605-ff879c29b0e4

### Multi-modal AI agents that watch, listen, and understand video.

Vision Agents give you the building blocks to create intelligent, low-latency video experiences powered by your models,
your infrastructure, and your use cases.

### Key Highlights

- **Video AI:** Built for real-time video AI. Combine YOLO, Roboflow, and others with Gemini/OpenAI in real-time.
- **Low Latency:** Join quickly (500ms) and maintain audio/video latency under 30ms
  using [Stream's edge network](https://getstream.io/video/).
- **Open:** Built by Stream, but works with any video edge network.
- **Native APIs:** Native SDK methods from OpenAI (`create response`), Gemini (`generate`), and Claude (
  `create message`) — always access the latest LLM capabilities.
- **SDKs:** SDKs for React, Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, and Unity, powered by Stream's ultra-low-latency
  network.

## See It In Action

### Sports Coaching

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1258ac2-ca98-4019-80e4-41ec5530117e

This example shows you how to build golf coaching AI with YOLO and Gemini Live.
Combining a fast object detection model (like YOLO) with a full realtime AI is useful for many different video AI use
cases.
For example: Drone fire detection, sports/video game coaching, physical therapy, workout coaching, just dance style
games etc.

```python
# partial example, full example: examples/02_golf_coach_example/golf_coach_example.py
agent = Agent(
    edge=getstream.Edge(),
    agent_user=agent_user,
    instructions="Read @golf_coach.md",
    llm=gemini.Realtime(fps=10),
    # llm=openai.Realtime(fps=1), # Careful with FPS can get expensive
    processors=[ultralytics.YOLOPoseProcessor(model_path="yolo11n-pose.pt", device="cuda")],
)
```

### Security Camera with Package Theft Detection

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92a2cdd8-909c-46d8-aab7-039a90efc186

This example shows a security camera system that detects faces, tracks packages and detects when a package is stolen. It
automatically generates "WANTED" posters, posting them to X in real-time.

It combines face recognition, YOLOv11 object detection, Nano Banana and Gemini for a complete security workflow with
voice interaction.

```python
# partial example, full example: examples/04_security_camera_example/security_camera_example.py
security_processor = SecurityCameraProcessor(
    fps=5,
    model_path="weights_custom.pt",  # YOLOv11 for package detection
    package_conf_threshold=0.7,
)

agent = Agent(
    edge=getstream.Edge(),
    agent_user=User(name="Security AI", id="agent"),
    instructions="Read @instructions.md",
    processors=[security_processor],
    llm=gemini.LLM("gemini-2.5-flash-lite"),
    tts=elevenlabs.TTS(),
    stt=deepgram.STT(),
)
```

### Cluely style Invisible Assistant (coming soon)

Apps like Cluely offer realtime coaching via an invisible overlay. This example shows you how you can build your own
invisible assistant.
It combines Gemini realtime (to watch your screen and audio), and doesn't broadcast audio (only text). This approach
is quite versatile and can be used for: Sales coaching, job interview cheating, physical world/ on the job coaching with
glasses

Demo video

```python
agent = Agent(
    edge=StreamEdge(),  # low latency edge. clients for React, iOS, Android, RN, Flutter etc.
    agent_user=agent_user,  # the user object for the agent (name, image etc)
    instructions="You are silently helping the user pass this interview. See @interview_coach.md",
    # gemini realtime, no need to set tts, or sst (though that's also supported)
    llm=gemini.Realtime()
)
```

## Features

| **Feature**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **True real-time via WebRTC**       | Stream directly to model providers that support it for instant visual understanding.                                                                  |
| **Interval/processor pipeline**     | For providers without WebRTC, process frames with pluggable video processors (e.g., YOLO, Roboflow, or custom PyTorch/ONNX) before/after model calls. |
| **Turn detection & diarization**    | Keep conversations natural; know when the agent should speak or stay quiet and who's talking.                                                         |
| **Voice activity detection (VAD)**  | Trigger actions intelligently and use resources efficiently.                                                                                          |

| **Tool/function calling**           | Execute arbitrary code and APIs mid-conversation. Create Linear issues, query weather, trigger telephony, or hit internal services.                   |
| **Built-in memory via Stream Chat** | Agents recall context naturally across turns and sessions.                                                                                            |

## Processors

Processors let your agent **manage state** and **handle audio/video** in real-time.

They take care of the hard stuff, like:

- Running smaller models
- Making API calls
- Transforming media

… so you can focus on your agent logic.

## Vision AI limitations

Video AI is the frontier of AI. The state of the art is changing daily to help models understand live video.
While building the integrations, here are the limitations we've noticed (Dec 2025)

* Video AI struggles with small text. If you want the AI to read the score in a game it will often get it wrong and
  hallucinate
* Longer videos can cause the AI to lose context. For instance if it's watching a soccer match it will get confused
  after 30 seconds
* Most applications require a combination of small specialized models like Yolo/Roboflow/Moondream, API calls to get
  more context and larger models like gemini/openAI
* Image size & FPS need to stay relatively low due to performance constraints
* Video doesn’t trigger responses in realtime models. You always need to send audio/text to trigger a response.

## We are hiring

Join the team behind this project - we’re hiring a Staff Python Engineer to architect, build, and maintain a powerful
toolkit for developers integrating voice and video AI into their products.
