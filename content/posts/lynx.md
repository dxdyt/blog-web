## About Lynx

Lynx is a _family_ of open-source technologies empowering developers to use their existing web skills to create truly native UIs for both mobile and web from a single codebase, featuring performance at scale and velocity.
- **💫 Write Once, Render Anywhere.** Enjoy native rendering on Android, iOS, and Web, or pixel-perfect consistency across mobile and desktop via our custom renderer.
- **🌐 Web-Inspired Design.** Leverage your existing knowledge of CSS and React. We designed Lynx with the web knowledge and libraries in mind.
- **⚡ Performance at Scale.** Achieve instant launch and silky UI responsiveness via our multithreaded engine, whether standalone or embedded.

This repository contains the **core engine** of Lynx. For other repositories in the Lynx family, visit our [org homepage](https://github.com/lynx-family).
