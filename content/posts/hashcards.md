![Screenshot of the app, showing a front/back flashcard.](screenshot.webp)

A plain text-based spaced repetition system. Features:

- **Plain Text:** all your flashcards are stored as plain text files, so you can
  operate on them with standard tools, write with your editor of choice, and
  track changes in a VCS.
- **Content Addressable:** cards are identified by the hash of their text. This
  means a card's progress is reset when the card is edited.
- **Low Friction:** you create flashcards by typing into a text file, using a
  lightweight notation to denote flashcard sides and cloze deletions.
- **Simple:** the only card types are front-back and cloze cards. More complex
  workflows (e.g.: Anki-style note types, card templates, automation) be can
  implemented using a Makefile and some scripts.
- **Efficient:** uses [FSRS] for scheduling reviews, maximizing learning while
  minimizing time spent reviewing.

Announcement blog post: [Hashcards: A Plain-Text Spaced Repetition System][blog].

## Example

The following Markdown file is a valid hashcards deck:

```
Q: How many neurons are there in the human brain?
A: ~80 billion.

C: An [agonist] is a ligand that binds to a receptor and [activates it].

Q: How many synapses are there in a human brain?
A: ~100 trillion

C: In the nervous system, [chemical] communication happens [between] neurons.
```

For a larger example, see [my personal flashcards repo][fc].

## Building

You need [cargo] installed. You can get it through [rustup]. Then:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eudoxia0/hashcards.git
$ cd hashcards
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To drill flashcards in a directory, run:

```
$ hashcards drill $DIRNAME
```

## Tutorial

Create a directory for your flashcards, and add a Markdown file with some cards:

```bash
$ mkdir cards
$ cd cards
$ cat > Geography.md << 'EOF'
Q: What is Coulomb's constant?
A: The proportionality constant of the electric force.

Q: What is an object with zero net charge called?
A: Neutral.
EOF
```

A Markdown file is called a "deck", and the name of the file, sans extension, is
the name of the deck. This will be shown on top of the flashcard during reviews,
this saves you from having to specify the context in each of the flashcards.

Start drilling:

```bash
$ hashcards drill
```

This opens a web interface at `http://localhost:8000` where you can review your
cards. The interface is simple: you read the question, mentally recall the
answer, and click reveal (or press space). Then you grade yourself on how you
did, with one of four choices:

1. Forgot (shortcut: `1`)
2. Hard (shortcut: `2`)
3. Good (shortcut: `3`)
4. Easy (shortcut: `4`)

Be honest. If you got the answer almost right, press "Forgot". If you mis-grade
something, you can undo (shortcut: `u`). The session ends when every card has
been graded "Good" or higher. You can end the session prematurely by clicking
"End", this will save your changes.

To learn how to write good flashcards, read [Effective Spaced Repetition][esr].

## Commands

This section documents the hashcards command line interface.

### `drill`

Start a drilling session.

```bash
$ hashcards drill [DIRECTORY]
```

Note: your progress is not saved until the session ends, either when you run out
of cards, or when you click "End".

Options:

- `--card-limit=<N>`: Limit the session to at most N cards.
- `--new-card-limit=<N>`: Limit the number of new cards in the session.
- `--port=<PORT>`: Use a specific port (default: 8000).
- `--from-deck=<NAME>`: Only drill cards from a deck with the given name.
- `--open-browser=<true|false>`: Whether or not to open the browser after the
  server starts (default: true).

### `stats`

Print collection statistics to standard output.

```bash
$ hashcards stats [DIRECTORY]
```

Options:

- `--format=<FORMAT>`: Output format (`html` or `json`)

At present, only JSON output is supported.

### `check`

Check the integrity of a collection.

```bash
$ hashcards check [DIRECTORY]
```

### `orphans`

Manage orphan cards (cards that exist in the database, but not in the
collection, i.e., cards that were deleted from the collection).

```bash
$ hashcards orphans list [DIRECTORY]
$ hashcards orphans delete [DIRECTORY]
```

Example:

```
$ hashcards orphans list Cards
04effc035b71692b66a90a622559479516526e7720c41afa22b29562915d58af
059e4e0fd5c3d0ab7ef0cc902cdc402a555ec4152b842fe584109de6c8082ce3
061b8c27e0f437d0c6ae735e829b39cc3bf0ad8218cb16387dcb4271c20b244d
$ hashcards orphans delete Cards
04effc035b71692b66a90a622559479516526e7720c41afa22b29562915d58af
059e4e0fd5c3d0ab7ef0cc902cdc402a555ec4152b842fe584109de6c8082ce3
061b8c27e0f437d0c6ae735e829b39cc3bf0ad8218cb16387dcb4271c20b244d
$ hashcards orphans list Cards
# no output
```

### `export`

Export a collection to a JSON file.

```bash
$ hashcards export [DIRECTORY]
```

Options:

- `--output=<PATH>`: The path to the output. By default, the export is printed
  to stdout.

## Format

This section describes the text format used by hashcards.

### Basic Cards

Question-answer flashcards are written like this:

```
Q: What are the possible values of electric charge?
A: Any integer multiple of the fundamental charge.
```

Both the question and the answer can span multiple lines:

```
Q: List the elements of the Platinum group.
A:

- ruthenium
- rhodium
- palladium
- osmium
- iridium
- platinum
```

### Cloze Cards

Cloze cards start with the `C:` tag, and use square brackets to denote cloze
deletions:

```
C: The [order] of a group is [the cardinality of its underlying set].
```

Again, cloze cards can span multiple lines:

```
C:
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

— [Ecclesiastes] [6]:[9]
```

## Features

This section documents specific hashcards features.

### LaTeX Support

Cards support LaTeX math via KaTeX.

Use `$...$` for inline math:

```
Q: What is the combinatorial meaning of $\binom{n}{k}$?
A: From a set of size $n$, we can choose $\binom{n}{k}$ subsets of size $k$.
```

And `$$...$$` for display math:

```
C: The [amount of substance] of a sample, denoted $n$, is defined as:

$$
n = \frac{N}{N_A}
$$

where $N$ is [the number of elementary entities] and $N_A$ is [Avogadro's constant].
```

You can define custom LaTeX macros by creating a `macros.tex` file in your
collection root:

```
\C \mathbb{C}
\R \mathbb{R}
```

Macro definitions can refer to arguments: `#1` for the first, `#2` for the
second and so on.

### Images

Ordinary Markdown image syntax works:

```
Q: Identify this painting:

![](art/diagram.png)

A: _The Siren_, by John William Waterhouse.
```

By default, image paths are resolved relative to the deck (the Markdown file)
that contains the flashcard. For example, if you have:

```
cards/
  Art Theory/
    Art.md
    Images/
      TheMermaid.jpg
      Circe.jpg
      Odysseus.jpg
```

Then flashcards in `Art.md` can reference images with paths like
`Images/Circe.jpg`.

By prefixing a path with `@/`, you can point to images relative to the
collection root directory, e.g., a path like `@/Art Theory/Images/Circe.jpg`
will always resolve to the same path, even if the deck is moved around within
the collection.

### Audio

Works like images:

```
Q: How do you pronounce "پرنده" in Persian?
A: ![](audio/parande.mp3)
```

### Deck Names

By default, the filename of a deck is the name of a deck, e.g. a file
`Medicine.md` will be parsed as a deck called `Medicine`. It is possible to
override the name using [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) frontmatter, like so:

```
---
name = "Medicine"
---

C: The mitochondria is the [powerhouse] of the cell.
```

Regardless of the filename, cards in this deck will have `Medicine` as their
deck name. This is particularly useful when you want to organize a large number
of cards into different files, while keeping their deck name the same. For
example, when taking notes from a textbook, you might have something like so:

```
Principles of Neural Science/
  Ch1.md
  Ch2.md
  ...
```

But you don't want the cards in those Markdown files to have `Ch1`, `Ch2`, etc.
as their deck name. TOML frontmatter allows you to give each chapter deck the same
deck name.

## Database

hashcards stores card performance data and the review history in an SQLite3
database. The file is called `hashcards.db` and is found in the root of the card
directory (i.e., the path you pass to the `drill` command).

The `cards` table has the following schema:

| Column             | Type               | Description                                                                                                                         |

| `review_count`     | `integer not null` | The number of times the card has been reviewed.                                                                                     |

The `sessions` table has the following schema:

| Column       | Type                  | Description                                                  |
