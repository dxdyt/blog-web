## 1. What's HeyGem

**HeyGem** is a free and open-source AI avatar project developed by **Duix.com**.

Seven years ago, a group of young pioneers chose an unconventional technical path, developing a method to train digital human models using real-person video data. Unlike traditional costly 3D digital human approaches, we leveraged AI-generated technology to create ultra-realistic digital humans, slashing production costs from hundreds of thousands of dollars to just $1,000. This innovation has empowered over 10,000 enterprises and generated over 500,000 personalized avatars for professionals across fields – educators, content creators, legal experts, medical practitioners, and entrepreneurs – dramatically enhancing their video production efficiency. However, our vision extends beyond commercial applications. We believe this transformative technology should be accessible to everyone. To democratize digital human creation, we've open-sourced our cloning technology and video production framework. Our commitment remains: breaking down technological barriers to make cutting-edge tools available to all. Now, anyone with a computer can freely craft their own AI Avatar and produce videos at zero cost – this is the essence of  **HeyGem**.

## 2. Introduction

    ![img](README.assets/13.png)

    ![img](README.assets/3.png)


#### **Installing the Server**

Installation using Docker, docker-compose as follows:

1. The `docker-compose.yml` file is in the `/deploy` directory.
2. Execute `docker-compose up -d` in the `/deploy` directory, if you want to use the lite version, execute `docker-compose -f docker-compose-lite.yml up -d`
3. Wait patiently (about half an hour, speed depends on network), download will consume about 70GB of traffic, make sure to use WiFi
4. When you see three services in Docker, it indicates success (the lite version has only one service `heygem-gen-video`)

#### **Server Deployment Solution for NVIDIA 50 Series Graphics Cards**

For 50 series graphics cards (tested and also works for 30/40 series with CUDA 12.8) Uses the official preview version of PyTorch

#### **Client**

1. Directly download the [officially built installation package](https://github.com/GuijiAI/HeyGem.ai/releases)
2. Double-click `HeyGem-x.x.x-setup.exe` to install

### Mode 2：Ubuntu 22.04 Installation

**System Requirements：**

We have conducted a complete test on **Ubuntu 22.04**. However, theoretically, it supports desktop Linux distributions.

**Hardware Requirements：**

- Recommended Configuration
- CPU: 13th Generation Intel Core i5 - 13400F
- Memory: 32G or more (necessary)
- Graphics Card: RTX - 4070 (Ensure you have an NVIDIA graphics card and the graphics card driver is correctly installed)
- Hard Disk: Free space greater than 100G

**Install Docker:**

First, use` docker --version` to check if Docker is installed. If it is installed, skip the following steps.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

**Install the graphics card driver:**

1. Install the graphics card driver by referring to the official documentation(https://www.nvidia.cn/drivers/lookup/).

After installation, execute the `nvidia-smi` command. If the graphics card information is displayed, the installation is successful.

2. Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit

​    The NVIDIA Container Toolkit is a necessary tool for Docker to use NVIDIA GPUs. The installation steps are as follows:

- Add the NVIDIA package repository:

```
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
```

- Update the package list and install the toolkit:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```

- Configure Docker to use the NVIDIA runtime:

```
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
```

- Restart the Docker service:

```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### **Install the server**

```
cd /deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yml up -d
```

#### **Install the client**

1. Directly download the Linux version of the [officially built installation package](https://github.com/GuijiAI/HeyGem.ai/releases).
2. Double click `HeyGem-x.x.x.AppImage` to launch it. No installation is required.

Reminder: In the Ubuntu system, if you enter the desktop as the `root` user, directly double - clicking `HeyGem - x.x.x.AppImage` may not work. You need to execute `./HeyGem - x.x.x.AppImage --no - sandbox` in the command - line terminal. Adding the `--no - sandbox` parameter will do the trick.



## 4. Open APIs
