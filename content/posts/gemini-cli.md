## 🚀 Getting Started

### Basic Usage

#### Start in current directory

```bash
gemini
```

```bash
gemini --include-directories ../lib,../docs
```

#### Use specific model

```bash
gemini -m gemini-2.5-flash
```

#### Non-interactive mode for scripts

Get a simple text response:

```bash
gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase"
```

For more advanced scripting, including how to parse JSON and handle errors, use
the `--output-format json` flag to get structured output:

```bash
gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase" --output-format json
```
