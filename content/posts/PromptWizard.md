## Overview 🌟
<p align="center">Overview of the PromptWizard framework</p>
<img src="./images/overview.png" >

PromptWizard is a discrete prompt optimization framework that employs a self-evolving mechanism where the LLM generates, critiques, and refines its own prompts and examples, continuously improving through iterative feedback and synthesis. This self-adaptive approach ensures holistic optimization by evolving both the instructions and in-context learning examples for better task performance.

Three key components of PromptWizard are te following :

- Feedback-driven Refinement: LLM generates, critiques, and refines its own prompts and examples, continuously improving through iterative feedback and synthesis​
- Critique and Synthesize diverse examples: Generates synthetic examples that are robust, diverse and task-aware. Also it optimizes both prompt and examples in tandem​
- Self generated Chain of Thought (CoT) steps with combination of positive, negative and synthetic examples

## Quickstart 🏃

There are three main ways to use PromptWizard:
- Scenario 1 : Optimizing prompts without examples
- Scenario 2 : Generating synthetic examples and using them to optimize prompts
- Scenario 3 : Optimizing prompts with training data

**NOTE** : Refer this [notebook](demos/scenarios/dataset_scenarios_demo.ipynb) to get a detailed understanding of the usage for each of the scenarios. **This serves as a starting point to understand the usage of PromptWizard**

#### High level overview of using PromptWizard
- Decide your scenario
- Fix the configuration and environmental varibles for API calling
  - Use ```promptopt_config.yaml``` to set configurations. For example for GSM8k this [file](demos/gsm8k/configs/promptopt_config.yaml) can be used
  - Use ```.env``` to set environmental varibles. For GSM8k this [file](demos/gsm8k/.env) can be used
  ```
  AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="XXXXX" 
  # Replace with your Azure OpenAI Endpoint

  OPENAI_API_VERSION="XXXX"
  # Replace with the version of your API

  AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="XXXXX"
  # Create a deployment for the model and place the deployment name here. 
  ```
- Run the code
  - To run PromptWizard on your custom dataset please jump [here](#run-on-custom-dataset) 

#### Running PromptWizard with training data (Scenario 3)
- We support [GSM8k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k), [SVAMP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChilleD/SVAMP), [AQUARAT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepmind/aqua_rat) and [Instruction_Induction(BBII)](https://github.com/xqlin98/INSTINCT/tree/main/Induction/experiments/data/instruction_induction/raw) datasets
- Please note that time taken for prompt optimzation is dependent on the dataset. In our experiments for the above mentioned datasets, it took around 20 - 30 minutes on average.

#### Running on GSM8k (AQUARAT/SVAMP)

- Please note that this code requires access to LLMs via API calling, we use AZURE endpoints for this
- Set the AZURE endpoint configurations in [.env](demos/gsm8k/.env)
- Follow the steps in [demo.ipynb](demos/gsm8k/demo.ipynb) to download the data, run the prompt optimization and carry out inference.

#### Running on BBII

- BBII has many datasets in it, based on the dataset set the configs [here](demos/bbh/configs/promptopt_config.yaml)
- In configs ```task_description```,```base_instruction``` and ```answer_format``` need to be changed for different datasets in BBII, the rest of the configs remain the same
- A demo is presented in  [demo.ipynb](demos/bbh/demo.ipynb)



## Run on Custom Datasets 🗃️

### Create Custom Dataset
- Our code expects the dataset to be in ```.jsonl``` file format
- Both the train and test set follow the same format
- Every sample in the ```.jsonl``` should have 2 fields :
  1) ```question``` : It should contain the complete question that is to asked to the LLM
  2) ```answer``` : It should contain the ground truth answer which can be verbose or consize


### Run on Custom Dataset

NOTE : Refer to [demos](demos) folder for examples of folders for four datasets. The ```.ipynb``` in each of the folders shows how to run PromptWizard on that particular dataset. A similar procedure can be followed for a new dataset. Below is the explanation of each of the components of the ```.ipynb``` and the dataset specifc folder structure in detail

#### Steps to be followed for custom datasets 

1) Every new dataset needs to have the following 
    - ```configs``` folder to store files for defining optimization hyperparameters and setup configs 
    - ```data``` folder to store ```train.jsonl``` and ```test.jsonl``` as curated [here](#create-custom-dataset) (this is done in the notebooks)
    - ```.env``` file for environment varibles to be used for API calling
    - ```.py/.ipynb``` script to run the code

2) Set the hyperparameters like number of mutations, refine steps, in-context examples etc.
    - Set the following in [promptopt_config.yaml](demos/gsm8k/configs/promptopt_config.yaml) : 
        - ```task_description``` : Desciption of the task at hand which will be fed into the prompt
          - For GSM8k a description like the following can be used
            ```
            You are a mathematics expert. You will be given a mathematics problem which you need to solve
            ```
        - ```base_instruction``` : Base instruction in line with the dataset
          - A commonly used base instruction could be
            ```
            Lets think step by step.
            ```
        - ```answer_format``` : Instruction for specifying the answer format
          - It is crucial to set the ```answer_format``` properly to ensure correct extraction by ```def extract_final_answer()```
          - Answer format could be :
            ```
            At the end, wrap only your final option between <ANS_START> and <ANS_END> tags
            ```
            Then in ```def extract_final_answer()``` we can simply write code to extract string between the tags
          
        - ```seen_set_size``` : The number of train samples to be used for prompt optimization
          - In our experiments we set this to be 25. In general any number between 20-50 would work 
        - ```few_shot_count``` : The number of in-context examples needed in the prompt
          - The value can be set to any positive integer based on the requirement
          - For generating zero-shot prompts, set the values to a small number (i.e between 2-5) and after the final prompt is generated the in-context examples can be removed. We suggest using some in-context examples as during the optimization process the instructions in the prompt are refined using in-context examples hence setting it to a small number will give better zero-shot instructions in the prompt
        - ```generate_reasoning``` : Whether or not to generate reasoning for the in-context examples
          - In our experiments we found it to improve the prompt overall as it provides a step-by-step approach to reach the final answer. However if there is a constraint on the prompt length or number of prompt tokens, it can be turned off to get smaller sized prompts
        - ```generate_expert_identity``` and ```generate_intent_keywords``` : Having these helped improve the prompt as they help making the prompt relevant to the task
    - Refer ```promptopt_config.yaml``` files in folders present [here](demos)  for the descriptions used for AQUARAT, SVAMP and GSM8k. For BBII refer [description.py](demos/bbh/description.py) which has the meta instructions for each of the datasets
    - Following are the global parameters which can be set based on the availability of the training data
      - ```run_without_train_examples``` is a global hyperparameter which can be used when there are no training samples and in-context examples are not required in the final prompt 
      - ```generate_synthetic_examples``` is a global hyperparameter which can be used when there are no training samples and we want to generate synthetic data for training 
      - ```use_examples``` is a global hyperparameter which can be used to optimize prompts using training data 
3) Create a dataset specific class which inherits ```class DatasetSpecificProcessing``` similar to ```GSM8k(DatasetSpecificProcessing)``` in [demo.ipynb](demos/gsm8k/demo.ipynb) and define the following functions in it
      1) In ```def extract_answer_from_output()``` : This is a dataset specific function, given the ```answer``` from the dataset it should extract and return  a consize form of the answer. Note that based on the dataset it can also simply return the ```answer``` as it is like in case of SVAMP and AQUARAT datasets
      2) ```def extract_final_answer()``` : This is a LLM output specific function, given the verbose answer from the LLM it should extract and return the consize final answer
      3) Define ```def access_answer()``` : This function takes an input the LLM output, then does the following:
         - Extracts the consize answer using ```def extract_final_answer()``` from the LLM output as defined above
         - Evaluates the extracted answer with the ground truth and retuns
            - Extracted answer from LLM output
            - Boolean value indicating if answer is correct or not
         - The evaluation done here is dataset specific, for datasets like GSM8k, SVAMP and AQUARAT which have final answer as an number, we can do a direct match between the numbers generated and the ground truth, while for datasets where the answer is a sentence or paragraph it would be better to do evaluation with llm-as-a-judge, to compare the generated and ground truth paragraph/sentence. An example is available in ```def access_answer()``` in [this](demos/bbh/demo.ipynb) notebook


## How PromptWizard Works 🔍
- Using the problem description and initial prompt instruction, PW generates variations of the instruction by prompting LLMs to mutate it. Based on performance, the best prompt is selected. PW incorporates a critique component that provides feedback, thus guiding and refining the prompt over multiple iterations. 
- PW also optimizes in-context examples. PW selects a diverse set of examples
from the training data, identifying positive and negative examples based on their performance with
the modified prompt. Negative examples help inform further prompt refinements. 
- Examples and instructions are sequentially optimized, using the critique to generate synthetic examples that address the current prompt’s weaknesses. These examples are integrated to further refine the prompt. 
- PW generates detailed reasoning chains via Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enriching the prompt’s capacity for problem-solving. 
- PW aligns prompts with human reasoning by integrating task intent and expert
personas, enhancing both model performance and interpretability.

## Configurations ⚙️ 

Here we define the various hyperparameters used in prompt optimization process found in [promptopt_config.yaml](demos/gsm8k/configs/promptopt_config.yaml)

- ```mutate_refine_iterations```: Number of iterations for conducting mutation of task description
 followed by refinement of instructions
- ```mutation_rounds```: Number of rounds of mutation to be performed when generating different styles
- ```refine_task_eg_iterations```: Number of iterations for refining task description and in context examples 
- ```style_variation```: Number of thinking style variations to be used in prompt mutation
- ```questions_batch_size```: Number of questions to be asked to LLM in a single batch, during training step
- ```min_correct_count```: Minimum number of batches of questions to correctly answered, for a prompt to be considered as performing good
- ```max_eval_batches```: Maximum number of mini-batches on which we should evaluate the prompt
- ```top_n```: Number of top best prompts to be considered from scoring stage for the next stage
- ```seen_set_size```: Number of samples from trainset to be used for training
- ```few_shot_count```: Number of in-context examples required in final prompt

## Best Practices 💡

Following are some of best pracitices we followed during are experiments 
- Regarding the parameters in [promptopt_config.yaml](demos/gsm8k/configs/promptopt_config.yaml)
    - We found the best performing values for ```mutate_refine_iterations```,```mutation_rounds```,```refine_task_eg_iterations``` to be 3 or 5
    - Other parameters have been set to their ideal values. ```seen_set_size``` can be increased to 50 and ```few_shot_count``` can be set based on the use case
- The prompts generated at the end of the training process are usually very detailed, however user supervision can help tune it further for the task at hand
- Trying both configurations of having synthetic in-context examples or in-context examples from the train set can be tried to find the best prompt based on use case. 

## Results 📈

<p align="center">
  <img src= "./images/curve.png" width="45%" />
  <p align="center">PromptWizard consistently outperforms other methods across various
thresholds, maintaining the highest p(τ) values, indicating that it consistently performs near the best
possible accuracy across all tasks</p>
</p>


- The fiqure shows the performance profile curve for the instruction induction
tasks. The performance profile curve visualizes how frequently
different approaches’ performance is within a given distance of the best performance. In this curve,
the x-axis (τ) represents the performance ratio relative to the best-performing method, and the y-axis
(p(τ )) reflects the fraction of tasks where a method’s performance is within this ratio. So for a given
method, the curve tells what percentage of the tasks are within τ distance to the best performance.
