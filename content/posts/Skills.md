# Skills Public

A collection of reusable development skills for Apple platforms, GitHub workflows, refactoring, diff review swarms, bug investigation swarms, code review, React performance work, and skill curation.

## Overview

This repository contains focused, self-contained skills that help with recurring engineering tasks such as generating App Store release notes, debugging iOS apps, improving SwiftUI and React code, packaging macOS apps, running multi-agent diff reviews and bug hunts, reviewing and simplifying code changes, orchestrating larger refactors, and auditing what new skills a project actually needs.

Install: place these skill folders under `$CODEX_HOME/skills`


## Skills

This repo currently includes 16 skills:

| Skill | Folder | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App Store Changelog | `app-store-changelog` | Creates user-facing App Store release notes from git history by collecting changes since the last tag, filtering for user-visible work, and rewriting it into concise "What's New" bullets. |
| GitHub | `github` | Uses the `gh` CLI to inspect and operate on GitHub issues, pull requests, workflow runs, and API data, including CI checks, run logs, and advanced queries. |
| iOS Debugger Agent | `ios-debugger-agent` | Uses XcodeBuildMCP to build, launch, and debug the current iOS app on a booted simulator, including UI inspection, interaction, screenshots, and log capture. |
| macOS Menubar Tuist App | `macos-menubar-tuist-app` | Builds, refactors, or reviews macOS menubar apps that use Tuist and SwiftUI, with emphasis on manifest ownership, store-layer architecture, and reliable local launch scripts. |
| macOS SwiftPM App Packaging (No Xcode) | `macos-spm-app-packaging` | Scaffolds, builds, packages, signs, and optionally notarizes SwiftPM-based macOS apps without requiring an Xcode project. |
| Orchestrate Batch Refactor | `orchestrate-batch-refactor` | Plans and executes larger refactor or rewrite efforts with dependency-aware parallel analysis and implementation using clearly scoped work packets. |
| Project Skill Audit | `project-skill-audit` | Analyzes a project's past Codex sessions, memory, existing local skills, and conventions to recommend the highest-value new skills or updates to existing ones. |
| React Component Performance | `react-component-performance` | Diagnoses slow React components by finding re-render churn, expensive render work, unstable props, and list bottlenecks, then suggests targeted optimizations and validation steps. |
| Bug Hunt Swarm | `bug-hunt-swarm` | Runs a read-only four-agent bug investigation focused on reproduction, code-path tracing, regressors, and the fastest proof step, then returns a ranked root-cause path. |
| Review and Simplify Changes | `review-and-simplify-changes` | Reviews a git diff or explicit file scope for reuse, code quality, efficiency, clarity, and standards issues, then optionally applies safe, behavior-preserving fixes. |
| Review Swarm | `review-swarm` | Runs a read-only four-agent diff review focused on behavioral regressions, security risks, performance or reliability issues, and contract or test coverage gaps, then returns a prioritized fix path. |
| Swift Concurrency Expert | `swift-concurrency-expert` | Reviews and fixes Swift 6.2+ concurrency issues such as actor isolation problems, `Sendable` violations, main-actor annotations, and data-race diagnostics. |
| SwiftUI Liquid Glass | `swiftui-liquid-glass` | Implements, reviews, or refactors SwiftUI features to use the iOS 26+ Liquid Glass APIs correctly, with proper modifier ordering, grouping, interactivity, and fallbacks. |
| SwiftUI Performance Audit | `swiftui-performance-audit` | Audits SwiftUI runtime performance from code and architecture, focusing on invalidation storms, identity churn, layout thrash, heavy render work, and profiling guidance. |
| SwiftUI UI Patterns | `swiftui-ui-patterns` | Provides best practices and example-driven guidance for building SwiftUI screens and components, including navigation, sheets, app wiring, async state, and reusable UI patterns. |
| SwiftUI View Refactor | `swiftui-view-refactor` | Refactors SwiftUI view files toward smaller subviews, MV-style data flow, stable view trees, explicit dependency injection, and correct Observation usage. |

## Usage

Each skill is self-contained. Refer to the `SKILL.md` file in each skill directory for triggers, workflow guidance, examples, and supporting references.

## Contributing

Skills are designed to be focused and reusable. When adding new skills, ensure they:
- Have a clear, single purpose
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Follow consistent patterns with existing skills
- Include reference materials when applicable
