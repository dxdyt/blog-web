### 🧠 **Agent Memory** (`/notebooks/agent_memory`)

Notebooks focused on the **[Oracle AI Agent Memory](https://www.oracle.com/database/ai-agent-memory/)** package (`oracleagentmemory`) — the AI-Agent Memory Package built on top of Oracle AI Database. These notebooks demonstrate how to use **Oracle AI Database as the unified memory core for AI agents**, serving conversation history, durable facts, and entity state from a single converged engine instead of stitching together a vector DB, key-value store, and relational store.

The collection covers the package's developer guide, benchmarks against naive memory, and three end-to-end framework examples (OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK, LangGraph).

> See the [Agent Memory README](./notebooks/agent_memory/README.md) for a recommended reading order, prerequisites, and Open-in-Colab links.

### 🎓 **Workshops** (`/workshops`)

Hands-on workshops and guided learning experiences that take developers from fundamentals to production patterns with Oracle AI Database. Each workshop is self-contained with a student notebook (TODO gaps to fill in), a complete reference notebook, step-by-step part guides, and a ready-to-run Codespaces / devcontainer environment with Oracle AI Database pre-configured. Workshops progress from information retrieval and RAG, through agentic systems and orchestration, to memory-augmented agents — together they cover the full stack for building AI applications on Oracle.

> **Pull a single workshop without cloning the whole hub** — each workshop README includes `git sparse-checkout` instructions so you can fetch only the folder you need.
