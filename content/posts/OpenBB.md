Open Data Platform by OpenBB (ODP) is the open-source toolset that helps data engineers integrate proprietary, licensed, and public data sources into downstream applications like AI copilots and research dashboards.

ODP operates as the "connect once, consume everywhere" infrastructure layer that consolidates and exposes data to multiple surfaces at once: Python environments for quants, OpenBB Workspace and Excel for analysts, MCP servers for AI agents, and REST APIs for other applications.

</a>

Get started with: `pip install openbb`

```python
from openbb import obb
output = obb.equity.price.historical("AAPL")
df = output.to_dataframe()
```

Data integrations available can be found here: <https://docs.openbb.co/python/reference>

## OpenBB Workspace

While the Open Data Platform provides the open-source data integration foundation, **OpenBB Workspace** offers the enterprise UI for analysts to visualize datasets and leverage AI agents. The platform's "connect once, consume everywhere" architecture enables seamless integration between the two.

You can find OpenBB Workspace at <https://pro.openbb.co>.

</a>

Data integration:

- You can learn more about adding data to the OpenBB workspace from the [docs](https://docs.openbb.co/workspace) or [this open source repository](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/backends-for-openbb).

AI Agents integration:

- You can learn more about adding AI agents to the OpenBB workspace from [this open source repository](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/agents-for-openbb).

### Integrating Open Data Platform to the OpenBB Workspace

Connect this library to the OpenBB Workspace with a few simple commands, in a Python (3.9.21 - 3.12) environment.

#### Run an ODP backend

- Install the packages.

```sh
pip install "openbb[all]"
```

- Start the API server over localhost.

```sh
openbb-api
```

This will launch a FastAPI server, via Uvicorn, at `127.0.0.1:6900`.

You can check that it works by going to <http://127.0.0.1:6900>.

#### Integrate the ODP Backend to OpenBB Workspace

Sign-in to the [OpenBB Workspace](https://pro.openbb.co/), and follow the following steps:

![CleanShot 2025-05-17 at 09 51 56@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75cffb4a-5e95-470a-b9d0-6ffd4067e069)

1. Go to the "Apps" tab
2. Click on "Connect backend"
3. Fill in the form with:
   Name: Open Data Platform
   URL: <http://127.0.0.1:6900>
4. Click on "Test". You should get a "Test successful" with the number of apps found.
5. Click on "Add".

That's it.
