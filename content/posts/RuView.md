> **Beta Software** — Under active development. APIs and firmware may change. Known limitations:
> - ESP32-C3 and original ESP32 are not supported (single-core, insufficient for CSI DSP)
> - Single ESP32 deployments have limited spatial resolution — use 2+ nodes or add a [Cognitum Seed](https://cognitum.one) for best results
> - Camera-free pose accuracy is limited (PCK@20 ≈ 2.5% with proxy labels) — [camera ground-truth training](docs/adr/ADR-079-camera-ground-truth-training.md) targets **35%+ PCK@20**; the pipeline is implemented, but the data-collection and evaluation phases (ADR-079 P7–P9) are still pending, so no measured camera-supervised PCK@20 has been published yet

## **See through walls with WiFi** ##

**Turn ordinary WiFi into a spatial intelligence / sensing system.** Detect people, measure breathing and heart rate, track movement, and monitor rooms — through walls, in the dark, with no cameras or wearables. Just physics.

### π RuView is a WiFi sensing platform that turns radio signals into spatial intelligence.

Every WiFi router already fills your space with radio waves. When people move, breathe, or even sit still, they disturb those waves in measurable ways. RuView captures these disturbances using Channel State Information (CSI) from low-cost ESP32 sensors and turns them into actionable data: who's there, what they're doing, and whether they're okay.

**What it senses:**
- **Presence and occupancy** — detect people through walls, count them, track entries and exits
- **Vital signs** — breathing rate and heart rate, contactless, while sleeping or sitting
- **Activity recognition** — walking, sitting, gestures, falls — from temporal CSI patterns
- **Environment mapping** — RF fingerprinting identifies rooms, detects moved furniture, spots new objects
- **Sleep quality** — overnight monitoring with sleep stage classification and apnea screening

Built on [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/) and [Cognitum Seed](https://cognitum.one), RuView runs entirely on edge hardware — an ESP32 mesh (as low as $9 per node) paired with a Cognitum Seed for persistent memory, cryptographic attestation, and AI integration. No cloud, no cameras, no internet required.

The system learns each environment locally using spiking neural networks that adapt in under 30 seconds, with multi-frequency mesh scanning across 6 WiFi channels that uses your neighbors' routers as free radar illuminators. Every measurement is cryptographically attested via an Ed25519 witness chain.

RuView also supports pose estimation (17 COCO keypoints via the WiFlow architecture), trained entirely without cameras using 10 sensor signals — a technique pioneered from the original *DensePose From WiFi* research at Carnegie Mellon University.

### Built for low-power edge applications

[Edge modules](#edge-intelligence-adr-041) are small programs that run directly on the ESP32 sensor — no internet needed, no cloud fees, instant response.

## 🔬 How It Works

WiFi routers flood every room with radio waves. When a person moves — or even breathes — those waves scatter differently. WiFi DensePose reads that scattering pattern and reconstructs what happened:

```
WiFi Router → radio waves pass through room → hit human body → scatter
    ↓
ESP32 mesh (4-6 nodes) captures CSI on channels 1/6/11 via TDM protocol
    ↓
Multi-Band Fusion: 3 channels × 56 subcarriers = 168 virtual subcarriers per link
    ↓
Multistatic Fusion: N×(N-1) links → attention-weighted cross-viewpoint embedding
    ↓
Coherence Gate: accept/reject measurements → stable for days without tuning
    ↓
Signal Processing: Hampel, SpotFi, Fresnel, BVP, spectrogram → clean features
    ↓
AI Backbone (RuVector): attention, graph algorithms, compression, field model
    ↓
Signal-Line Protocol (CRV): 6-stage gestalt → sensory → topology → coherence → search → model
    ↓
Neural Network: processed signals → 17 body keypoints + vital signs + room model
    ↓
Output: real-time pose, breathing, heart rate, room fingerprint, drift alerts
```

No training cameras required — the [Self-Learning system (ADR-024)](docs/adr/ADR-024-contrastive-csi-embedding-model.md) bootstraps from raw WiFi data alone. [MERIDIAN (ADR-027)](docs/adr/ADR-027-cross-environment-domain-generalization.md) ensures the model works in any room, not just the one it trained in.

## 🏢 Use Cases & Applications

WiFi sensing works anywhere WiFi exists. No new hardware in most cases — just software on existing access points or a $8 ESP32 add-on. Because there are no cameras, deployments avoid privacy regulations (GDPR video, HIPAA imaging) by design.

**Scaling:** Each AP distinguishes ~3-5 people (56 subcarriers). Multi-AP multiplies linearly — a 4-AP retail mesh covers ~15-20 occupants. No hard software limit; the practical ceiling is signal physics.

| | Why WiFi sensing wins | Traditional alternative |
|---|----------------------|----------------------|
| 🔒 | **No video, no GDPR/HIPAA imaging rules** | Cameras require consent, signage, data retention policies |
| 🧱 | **Works through walls, shelving, debris** | Cameras need line-of-sight per room |
| 🌙 | **Works in total darkness** | Cameras need IR or visible light |
| 💰 | **$0-$8 per zone** (existing WiFi or ESP32) | Camera systems: $200-$2,000 per zone |
| 🔌 | **WiFi already deployed everywhere** | PIR/radar sensors require new wiring per room |

<summary><strong>🧠 Self-Learning WiFi AI (ADR-024)</strong> — Adaptive recognition, self-optimization, and intelligent anomaly detection</summary>

Every WiFi signal that passes through a room creates a unique fingerprint of that space. WiFi-DensePose already reads these fingerprints to track people, but until now it threw away the internal "understanding" after each reading. The Self-Learning WiFi AI captures and preserves that understanding as compact, reusable vectors — and continuously optimizes itself for each new environment.

**What it does in plain terms:**
- Turns any WiFi signal into a 128-number "fingerprint" that uniquely describes what's happening in a room
- Learns entirely on its own from raw WiFi data — no cameras, no labeling, no human supervision needed
- Recognizes rooms, detects intruders, identifies people, and classifies activities using only WiFi
- Runs on an $8 ESP32 chip (the entire model fits in 55 KB of memory)
- Produces both body pose tracking AND environment fingerprints in a single computation

**Key Capabilities**

| What | How it works | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Self-supervised learning** | The model watches WiFi signals and teaches itself what "similar" and "different" look like, without any human-labeled data | Deploy anywhere — just plug in a WiFi sensor and wait 10 minutes |
| **Room identification** | Each room produces a distinct WiFi fingerprint pattern | Know which room someone is in without GPS or beacons |
| **Anomaly detection** | An unexpected person or event creates a fingerprint that doesn't match anything seen before | Automatic intrusion and fall detection as a free byproduct |
| **Person re-identification** | Each person disturbs WiFi in a slightly different way, creating a personal signature | Track individuals across sessions without cameras |
| **Environment adaptation** | MicroLoRA adapters (1,792 parameters per room) fine-tune the model for each new space | Adapts to a new room with minimal data — 93% less than retraining from scratch |
| **Memory preservation** | EWC++ regularization remembers what was learned during pretraining | Switching to a new task doesn't erase prior knowledge |
| **Hard-negative mining** | Training focuses on the most confusing examples to learn faster | Better accuracy with the same amount of training data |

**Architecture**

```
WiFi Signal [56 channels] → Transformer + Graph Neural Network
                                  ├→ 128-dim environment fingerprint (for search + identification)
                                  └→ 17-joint body pose (for human tracking)
```

**Quick Start**

```bash
# Step 1: Learn from raw WiFi data (no labels needed)
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --pretrain --dataset data/csi/ --pretrain-epochs 50

# Step 2: Fine-tune with pose labels for full capability
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --train --dataset data/mmfi/ --epochs 100 --save-rvf model.rvf

# Step 3: Use the model — extract fingerprints from live WiFi
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --model model.rvf --embed

# Step 4: Search — find similar environments or detect anomalies
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --model model.rvf --build-index env
```

**Training Modes**

| Mode | What you need | What you get |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Self-Supervised | Just raw WiFi data | A model that understands WiFi signal structure |
| Supervised | WiFi data + body pose labels | Full pose tracking + environment fingerprints |
| Cross-Modal | WiFi data + camera footage | Fingerprints aligned with visual understanding |

**Fingerprint Index Types**

| Index | What it stores | Real-world use |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| `env_fingerprint` | Average room fingerprint | "Is this the kitchen or the bedroom?" |
| `activity_pattern` | Activity boundaries | "Is someone cooking, sleeping, or exercising?" |
| `temporal_baseline` | Normal conditions | "Something unusual just happened in this room" |
| `person_track` | Individual movement signatures | "Person A just entered the living room" |

**Model Size**

| Component | Parameters | Memory (on ESP32) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Transformer backbone | ~28,000 | 28 KB |
| Embedding projection head | ~25,000 | 25 KB |
| Per-room MicroLoRA adapter | ~1,800 | 2 KB |
| **Total** | **~55,000** | **55 KB** (of 520 KB available) |

The self-learning system builds on the [AI Backbone (RuVector)](#ai-backbone-ruvector) signal-processing layer — attention, graph algorithms, and compression — adding contrastive learning on top.

See [`docs/adr/ADR-024-contrastive-csi-embedding-model.md`](docs/adr/ADR-024-contrastive-csi-embedding-model.md) for full architectural details.

## 🧩 Claude Code & Codex Plugin

RuView ships a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin (and Codex prompt mirror) that wraps the whole workflow — onboarding, ESP32 setup, configuration, sensing apps, model training, advanced multistatic sensing, CLI/API/WASM, mmWave radar, and witness verification — as 9 skills, 7 `/ruview-*` commands, and 3 agents. It lives in [`plugins/ruview/`](plugins/ruview/README.md); the marketplace manifest is [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) at the repo root.

```bash
# In Claude Code — add this repo as a plugin marketplace, then install:
/plugin marketplace add ruvnet/RuView
/plugin install ruview@ruview

# Or try it for one session without installing (from a local clone of the repo):
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/ruview

# Then, in Claude Code:
#   /ruview-start      → onboarding (Docker demo / repo build / live ESP32)
#   /ruview-flash      → build + flash ESP32 firmware
#   /ruview-provision  → provision WiFi creds, sink IP, channel/MAC, mesh slots
#   /ruview-app        → run a sensing application (presence / vitals / pose / sleep / MAT / point cloud)
#   /ruview-train      → train / evaluate / publish a model (incl. GPU on GCloud)
#   /ruview-advanced   → multistatic / tomography / cross-viewpoint / mesh-security
#   /ruview-verify     → tests + deterministic proof + witness bundle
```

**Codex (OpenAI CLI):** `cp plugins/ruview/codex/prompts/*.md ~/.codex/prompts/` — the seven `/ruview-*` commands are mirrored as Codex prompts; [`plugins/ruview/codex/AGENTS.md`](plugins/ruview/codex/AGENTS.md) carries the project rules. See [`plugins/ruview/codex/README.md`](plugins/ruview/codex/README.md).

Verify the plugin structure: `bash plugins/ruview/scripts/smoke.sh`. Full details: [`plugins/ruview/README.md`](plugins/ruview/README.md).
