## **See through walls with WiFi** ##

**Turn ordinary WiFi into a spatial intelligence / sensing system.** Detect people, measure breathing and heart rate, track movement, and monitor rooms — through walls, in the dark, with no cameras or wearables. Just physics.

Works natively with the four major smart-home ecosystems: **[Home Assistant](docs/integrations/home-assistant.md)** via the HA-DISCO MQTT publisher, **[Apple Home & HomePod](docs/user-guide-apple-homepod.md)** as a discoverable HAP-1.1 bridge, **[Google Home](docs/integrations/home-assistant.md)** + **[Amazon Alexa](docs/integrations/home-assistant.md)** via the same HA bridge or a [Matter](docs/adr/ADR-122-bfld-ruview-ha-matter-exposure.md) endpoint. Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa can voice presence and vitals by room with zero custom skills.

> Drop into any **Home Assistant** install with one `--mqtt` flag. Or pair into **Apple Home / Google Home / Alexa / SmartThings** as a Matter Bridge. Ships 21 entities per node (11 raw signals + 10 inferred semantic states: someone-sleeping, possible-distress, room-active, elderly-inactivity-anomaly, meeting-in-progress, bathroom-occupied, fall-risk-elevated, bed-exit, no-movement, multi-room-transition) plus 3 starter HA Blueprints.

### π RuView is a WiFi sensing platform that turns radio signals into spatial intelligence.

Every WiFi router already fills your space with radio waves. When people move, breathe, or even sit still, they disturb those waves in measurable ways. RuView captures these disturbances using Channel State Information (CSI) from low-cost ESP32 sensors and turns them into actionable data: who's there, what they're doing, and whether they're okay.

**What it senses:**
- **Presence and occupancy** — detect people through walls, count them, track entries and exits
- **Vital signs** — breathing rate and heart rate, contactless, while sleeping or sitting
- **Activity recognition** — walking, sitting, gestures, falls — from temporal CSI patterns
- **Environment mapping** — RF fingerprinting identifies rooms, detects moved furniture, spots new objects
- **Sleep quality** — overnight monitoring with sleep stage classification and apnea screening

Built on [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector/) and [Cognitum Seed](https://cognitum.one), RuView runs entirely on edge hardware — an ESP32 mesh (as low as $9 per node) paired with a Cognitum Seed for persistent memory, cryptographic attestation, and AI integration. No cloud, no cameras, no internet required.

The system learns each environment locally using spiking neural networks that adapt in under 30 seconds, with multi-frequency mesh scanning across 6 WiFi channels that uses your neighbors' routers as free radar illuminators. Every measurement is cryptographically attested via an Ed25519 witness chain.

RuView turns ordinary WiFi into a contactless sensor. A $9 ESP32 board reads the radio reflections off the people in a room, and a small pretrained model — published on Hugging Face at [`ruvnet/wifi-densepose-pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/ruvnet/wifi-densepose-pretrained) — tells you who's there, how they're breathing, and how their heart rate is trending. The model fits in 8 KB (4-bit quantized), runs in microseconds on a Raspberry Pi, and reports 100% presence accuracy on the validation set. No cameras, no wearables, no app on the user's phone.

### Built for low-power edge applications

[Edge modules](#edge-intelligence-adr-041) are small programs that run directly on the ESP32 sensor — no internet needed, no cloud fees, instant response.

```bash
# Option 1: Docker (simulated data, no hardware needed)
docker pull ruvnet/wifi-densepose:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 ruvnet/wifi-densepose:latest
# Open http://localhost:3000

# Option 2a: Live sensing with ESP32-S3 hardware ($9)
# Flash firmware, provision WiFi, and start sensing:
python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 --port COM9 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash 0x0 bootloader.bin 0x8000 partition-table.bin \
  0xf000 ota_data_initial.bin 0x20000 esp32-csi-node.bin
python firmware/esp32-csi-node/provision.py --port COM9 \
  --ssid "YourWiFi" --password "secret" --target-ip 192.168.1.20

# Option 2b: WiFi 6 + 802.15.4 research sensing with ESP32-C6 ($6-10, ADR-110)
# Same csi-node firmware compiled for the C6 target — picks up the C6
# overlay (sdkconfig.defaults.esp32c6) automatically.
cd firmware/esp32-csi-node
idf.py set-target esp32c6 && idf.py build
idf.py -p COM6 flash
# C6 boot extras (vs S3): HE-LTF subcarrier tagging in ADR-018 bytes 18-19,
#   802.15.4 mesh time-sync on channel 15, TWT setup when the AP supports it,
#   opt-in LP-core wake-on-motion for ~5 µA battery seed nodes.
# v0.6.7 adds: real LP-core RISC-V motion-gate program (debounce + motion
#   counter) and a Wi-Fi 6 soft-AP with TWT Responder so two C6 boards can
#   benchmark real iTWT without buying an 11ax router. Both default off,
#   flip CONFIG_C6_{LP_CORE,SOFTAP_HE}_ENABLE to turn them on.

# Option 3: Full system with Cognitum Seed ($140)
# ESP32 streams CSI → bridge forwards to Seed for persistent storage + kNN + witness chain
node scripts/rf-scan.js --port 5006           # Live RF room scan
node scripts/snn-csi-processor.js --port 5006  # SNN real-time learning
node scripts/mincut-person-counter.js --port 5006  # Correct person counting

# Option 4: Python — live on PyPI (ADR-117)
pip install ruview                        # or: pip install wifi-densepose
# Both ship the same compiled PyO3 wheel (~250 KB, abi3-py310, Linux/macOS/Windows).
# Add [client] for the asyncio WebSocket + paho-mqtt clients:
pip install "ruview[client]"              # or: pip install "wifi-densepose[client]"

# from ruview import BreathingExtractor, HeartRateExtractor   # equivalent to:
# from wifi_densepose import BreathingExtractor, HeartRateExtractor
# from ruview.client import SensingClient, RuViewMqttClient

> [!NOTE]
> **CSI-capable hardware recommended.** Presence, vital signs, through-wall sensing, and all advanced capabilities require Channel State Information (CSI) from an ESP32-S3 ($9) or research NIC. The Docker image runs with simulated data for evaluation. Consumer WiFi laptops provide RSSI-only presence detection.

> **Hardware options** for live CSI capture:
>
> | Option | Hardware | Cost | Full CSI | Capabilities |
> |--------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
> | **ESP32 + Cognitum Seed** (recommended) | ESP32-S3 + [Cognitum Seed](https://cognitum.one) | ~$140 | Yes | Presence, motion, breathing, heart rate, fall detection, multi-person counting, 17-keypoint pose (signed Cog binary), 105-cog catalog, persistent vector store, kNN search, witness chain, MCP proxy |
> | **ESP32 Mesh** | 3-6× ESP32-S3 + WiFi router | ~$54 | Yes | Same capabilities as above without the persistent-memory features |
> | **ESP32-C6 research node** ([ADR-110](docs/adr/ADR-110-esp32-c6-firmware-extension.md), [witness](docs/WITNESS-LOG-110.md), [reviewer guide](docs/ADR-110-REVIEW-GUIDE.md), [firmware v0.7.0](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/releases/tag/v0.7.0-esp32)) | ESP32-C6-DevKit ($6–10) | ~$10 | Yes (Wi-Fi 6 capable) | Same CSI pipeline as S3 with the dual-target firmware. **Firmware-side ADR-110 substrate now closed** (v0.7.0): ESP-NOW cross-board mesh quantified at **99.56 % match / 104 µs smoothed offset stdev / 3.95× EMA suppression** over a 5-min two-board soak (witness §A0.10), 32-byte UDP sync packet with operator-tunable cadence (§A0.12), ADR-018 byte 19 bit 4 wire-fix sourced from the working ESP-NOW path (§A0.13). Wire format ready for HE-LTF PPDU tagging in ADR-018 bytes 18-19 (firmware encoder + Rust + Python decoders verified end-to-end across 23 unit tests). LP-core motion-gate RISC-V program and Wi-Fi 6 soft-AP with TWT Responder both ship as opt-in code paths (default off). **Hardware-gated for measurement**: HE-LTF live subcarrier capture needs an 11ax AP (IDF v5.4 doesn't expose AP-side HE config — §A0.6); ~5 µA LP-core hibernation needs an INA meter to capture; 802.15.4 raw RX is broken in IDF v5.4 (workaround: ESP-NOW transport, shipped + measured). See witness log for the empirical / claimed split. |
> | **Research NIC** | Intel 5300 / Atheros AR9580 | ~$50-100 | Yes | Full CSI with 3x3 MIMO |
> | **Any WiFi** | Windows, macOS, or Linux laptop | $0 | No | RSSI-only: coarse presence and motion (see [tutorial #36](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/36)) |

## 🤗 Pretrained model on Hugging Face

Pretrained CSI weights live at [`ruvnet/wifi-densepose-pretrained`](https://huggingface.co/ruvnet/wifi-densepose-pretrained) — 12.2M training steps on 60K frames / 610K contrastive triplets, **100% presence accuracy** on the validation set, 4-bit quantized variant fits in 8 KB. The release includes a contrastive **CSI encoder** producing 128-dim embeddings (164,183 emb/s on M4 Pro) and a **presence-detection head**. Per-node LoRA adapters are included for environment-specific fine-tuning.

```bash
# Download the model bundle
pip install huggingface_hub
huggingface-cli download ruvnet/wifi-densepose-pretrained --local-dir models/wifi-densepose-pretrained
```

**What works today vs. what's pending wiring:**

| Consumer | Format used | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Python training / evaluation / embedding extraction | `model.safetensors` | ✅ Works — load with `safetensors.torch.load_file` |
| Inspect / re-export the bundle | `model.rvf.jsonl` (line-by-line JSON) | ✅ Works — plain JSONL |
| Sensing-server `--model <PATH>` flag | binary RVF (`RVFS` magic) | ⚠️ Loader does not yet accept the JSONL container |

**Known gap:** the HF model ships in JSONL RVF format, but `v2/crates/wifi-densepose-sensing-server/src/rvf_container.rs` only parses the binary RVF segment format. Pointing `--model` at `model.rvf.jsonl` currently errors with `invalid magic at offset 0: expected 0x52564653, got 0x7974227B` and the live pipeline degrades to null output rather than falling back to heuristic mode — so for the live sensing-server, run **without** `--model` until a JSONL adapter lands (or the model is re-published as binary RVF). Use the weights from Python / training in the meantime.

**Quantization choices** (all in the HF repo): `model-q2.bin` (4 KB) · `model-q4.bin` ⭐ recommended (8 KB) · `model-q8.bin` (16 KB) · `model.safetensors` full (48 KB)

The separate **17-keypoint pose-estimation model** is not in this release — pipeline is implemented but keypoint weights are still pending. Tracked in [#509](https://github.com/ruvnet/RuView/issues/509); see [ADR-079](docs/adr/ADR-079-camera-supervised-pose-finetune.md) phases P7–P9.

## 🔬 How It Works

WiFi routers flood every room with radio waves. When a person moves — or even breathes — those waves scatter differently. WiFi DensePose reads that scattering pattern and reconstructs what happened:

```
WiFi Router → radio waves pass through room → hit human body → scatter
    ↓
ESP32 mesh (4-6 nodes) captures CSI on channels 1/6/11 via TDM protocol
    ↓
Multi-Band Fusion: 3 channels × 56 subcarriers = 168 virtual subcarriers per link
    ↓
Multistatic Fusion: N×(N-1) links → attention-weighted cross-viewpoint embedding
    ↓
Coherence Gate: accept/reject measurements → stable for days without tuning
    ↓
Signal Processing: Hampel, SpotFi, Fresnel, BVP, spectrogram → clean features
    ↓
AI Backbone (RuVector): attention, graph algorithms, compression, field model
    ↓
Signal-Line Protocol (CRV): 6-stage gestalt → sensory → topology → coherence → search → model
    ↓
Neural Network: processed signals → 17 body keypoints + vital signs + room model
    ↓
Output: real-time pose, breathing, heart rate, room fingerprint, drift alerts
```

No training cameras required — the [Self-Learning system (ADR-024)](docs/adr/ADR-024-contrastive-csi-embedding-model.md) bootstraps from raw WiFi data alone. [MERIDIAN (ADR-027)](docs/adr/ADR-027-cross-environment-domain-generalization.md) ensures the model works in any room, not just the one it trained in.

## 🏢 Use Cases & Applications

WiFi sensing works anywhere WiFi exists. No new hardware in most cases — just software on existing access points or a $8 ESP32 add-on. Because there are no cameras, deployments avoid privacy regulations (GDPR video, HIPAA imaging) by design.

**Scaling:** Each AP distinguishes ~3-5 people (56 subcarriers). Multi-AP multiplies linearly — a 4-AP retail mesh covers ~15-20 occupants. No hard software limit; the practical ceiling is signal physics.

| | Why WiFi sensing wins | Traditional alternative |
|---|----------------------|----------------------|
| 🔒 | **No video, no GDPR/HIPAA imaging rules** | Cameras require consent, signage, data retention policies |
| 🧱 | **Works through walls, shelving, debris** | Cameras need line-of-sight per room |
| 🌙 | **Works in total darkness** | Cameras need IR or visible light |
| 💰 | **$0-$8 per zone** (existing WiFi or ESP32) | Camera systems: $200-$2,000 per zone |
| 🔌 | **WiFi already deployed everywhere** | PIR/radar sensors require new wiring per room |

<summary><strong>🧠 Self-Learning WiFi AI (ADR-024)</strong> — Adaptive recognition, self-optimization, and intelligent anomaly detection</summary>

Every WiFi signal that passes through a room creates a unique fingerprint of that space. WiFi-DensePose already reads these fingerprints to track people, but until now it threw away the internal "understanding" after each reading. The Self-Learning WiFi AI captures and preserves that understanding as compact, reusable vectors — and continuously optimizes itself for each new environment.

**What it does in plain terms:**
- Turns any WiFi signal into a 128-number "fingerprint" that uniquely describes what's happening in a room
- Learns entirely on its own from raw WiFi data — no cameras, no labeling, no human supervision needed
- Recognizes rooms, detects intruders, identifies people, and classifies activities using only WiFi
- Runs on an $8 ESP32 chip (the entire model fits in 55 KB of memory)
- Produces both body pose tracking AND environment fingerprints in a single computation

**Key Capabilities**

| What | How it works | Why it matters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Self-supervised learning** | The model watches WiFi signals and teaches itself what "similar" and "different" look like, without any human-labeled data | Deploy anywhere — just plug in a WiFi sensor and wait 10 minutes |
| **Room identification** | Each room produces a distinct WiFi fingerprint pattern | Know which room someone is in without GPS or beacons |
| **Anomaly detection** | An unexpected person or event creates a fingerprint that doesn't match anything seen before | Automatic intrusion and fall detection as a free byproduct |
| **Person re-identification** | Each person disturbs WiFi in a slightly different way, creating a personal signature | Track individuals across sessions without cameras |
| **Environment adaptation** | MicroLoRA adapters (1,792 parameters per room) fine-tune the model for each new space | Adapts to a new room with minimal data — 93% less than retraining from scratch |
| **Memory preservation** | EWC++ regularization remembers what was learned during pretraining | Switching to a new task doesn't erase prior knowledge |
| **Hard-negative mining** | Training focuses on the most confusing examples to learn faster | Better accuracy with the same amount of training data |

**Architecture**

```
WiFi Signal [56 channels] → Transformer + Graph Neural Network
                                  ├→ 128-dim environment fingerprint (for search + identification)
                                  └→ 17-joint body pose (for human tracking)
```

**Quick Start**

```bash
# Step 1: Learn from raw WiFi data (no labels needed)
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --pretrain --dataset data/csi/ --pretrain-epochs 50

# Step 2: Fine-tune with pose labels for full capability
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --train --dataset data/mmfi/ --epochs 100 --save-rvf model.rvf

# Step 3: Use the model — extract fingerprints from live WiFi
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --model model.rvf --embed

# Step 4: Search — find similar environments or detect anomalies
cargo run -p wifi-densepose-sensing-server -- --model model.rvf --build-index env
```

**Training Modes**

| Mode | What you need | What you get |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Self-Supervised | Just raw WiFi data | A model that understands WiFi signal structure |
| Supervised | WiFi data + body pose labels | Full pose tracking + environment fingerprints |
| Cross-Modal | WiFi data + camera footage | Fingerprints aligned with visual understanding |

**Fingerprint Index Types**

| Index | What it stores | Real-world use |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| `env_fingerprint` | Average room fingerprint | "Is this the kitchen or the bedroom?" |
| `activity_pattern` | Activity boundaries | "Is someone cooking, sleeping, or exercising?" |
| `temporal_baseline` | Normal conditions | "Something unusual just happened in this room" |
| `person_track` | Individual movement signatures | "Person A just entered the living room" |

**Model Size**

| Component | Parameters | Memory (on ESP32) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Transformer backbone | ~28,000 | 28 KB |
| Embedding projection head | ~25,000 | 25 KB |
| Per-room MicroLoRA adapter | ~1,800 | 2 KB |
| **Total** | **~55,000** | **55 KB** (of 520 KB available) |

The self-learning system builds on the [AI Backbone (RuVector)](#ai-backbone-ruvector) signal-processing layer — attention, graph algorithms, and compression — adding contrastive learning on top.

## 🧩 Claude Code & Codex Plugin

RuView ships a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin (and Codex prompt mirror) that wraps the whole workflow — onboarding, ESP32 setup, configuration, sensing apps, model training, advanced multistatic sensing, CLI/API/WASM, mmWave radar, and witness verification — as 9 skills, 7 `/ruview-*` commands, and 3 agents. It lives in [`plugins/ruview/`](plugins/ruview/README.md); the marketplace manifest is [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) at the repo root.

```bash
# In Claude Code — add this repo as a plugin marketplace, then install:
/plugin marketplace add ruvnet/RuView
/plugin install ruview@ruview

# Or try it for one session without installing (from a local clone of the repo):
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/ruview

# Then, in Claude Code:
#   /ruview-start      → onboarding (Docker demo / repo build / live ESP32)
#   /ruview-flash      → build + flash ESP32 firmware
#   /ruview-provision  → provision WiFi creds, sink IP, channel/MAC, mesh slots
#   /ruview-app        → run a sensing application (presence / vitals / pose / sleep / MAT / point cloud)
#   /ruview-train      → train / evaluate / publish a model (incl. GPU on GCloud)
#   /ruview-advanced   → multistatic / tomography / cross-viewpoint / mesh-security
#   /ruview-verify     → tests + deterministic proof + witness bundle
```

**Codex (OpenAI CLI):** `cp plugins/ruview/codex/prompts/*.md ~/.codex/prompts/` — the seven `/ruview-*` commands are mirrored as Codex prompts; [`plugins/ruview/codex/AGENTS.md`](plugins/ruview/codex/AGENTS.md) carries the project rules. See [`plugins/ruview/codex/README.md`](plugins/ruview/codex/README.md).

Verify the plugin structure: `bash plugins/ruview/scripts/smoke.sh`. Full details: [`plugins/ruview/README.md`](plugins/ruview/README.md).

| [Semantic Primitives — Precision/Recall](docs/integrations/semantic-primitives-metrics.md) | Per-primitive F1 on the held-out paired-capture set: someone-sleeping, possible-distress, room-active, elderly-inactivity-anomaly, meeting, bathroom, fall-risk, bed-exit, no-movement, multi-room. |
| [Claude Code / Codex Plugin](plugins/ruview/README.md) | The `ruview` plugin + marketplace — skills, `/ruview-*` commands, agents, and the Codex prompt mirror |
| [Architecture Decisions](docs/adr/README.md) | 96 ADRs — why each technical choice was made, organized by domain (hardware, signal processing, ML, platform, infrastructure) |
| [Domain Models](docs/ddd/README.md) | 8 DDD models (RuvSense, Signal Processing, Training Pipeline, Hardware Platform, Sensing Server, WiFi-Mat, CHCI, rvCSI) — bounded contexts, aggregates, domain events, and ubiquitous language |
| [rvCSI — edge RF sensing runtime](https://github.com/ruvnet/rvcsi) | Rust-first / TypeScript-accessible / hardware-abstracted CSI runtime: multi-source ingestion (incl. real nexmon_csi `.pcap` from a **Raspberry Pi 5** / Pi 4 / Pi 3B+ — CYW43455 / BCM43455c0) → validation → DSP → typed events → RuVector RF memory ([ADR-095](docs/adr/ADR-095-rvcsi-edge-rf-sensing-platform.md), [ADR-096](docs/adr/ADR-096-rvcsi-ffi-crate-layout.md), [domain model](docs/ddd/rvcsi-domain-model.md)). Now its own repo — [`ruvnet/rvcsi`](https://github.com/ruvnet/rvcsi) — vendored here under `vendor/rvcsi`; 9 `rvcsi-*` crates on crates.io, `@ruv/rvcsi` on npm, plus a Claude Code plugin. |
| [Desktop App](v2/crates/wifi-densepose-desktop/README.md) | **WIP** — Tauri v2 desktop app for node management, OTA updates, WASM deployment, and mesh visualization |

## 🚧 Beta software

> **Beta Software** — Under active development. APIs and firmware may change. Known limitations:
> - ESP32-C3 and original ESP32 are not supported (single-core, insufficient for CSI DSP)
> - Single ESP32 deployments have limited spatial resolution — use 2+ nodes or add a [Cognitum Seed](https://cognitum.one) for best results
> - Camera-free pose accuracy is limited (PCK@20 ≈ 2.5% with proxy labels) — [camera ground-truth training](docs/adr/ADR-079-camera-ground-truth-training.md) targets **35%+ PCK@20**; the pipeline is implemented, but the data-collection and evaluation phases (ADR-079 P7–P9) are still pending.
