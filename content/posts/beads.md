**Docs:** https://gastownhall.github.io/beads/

Beads provides a persistent, structured memory for coding agents. It replaces messy markdown plans with a dependency-aware graph, allowing agents to handle long-horizon tasks without losing context.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install beads CLI (system-wide - don't clone this repo into your project)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gastownhall/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Initialize in YOUR project
cd your-project
bd init

# Tell your agent
echo "Use 'bd' for task tracking" >> AGENTS.md
```

**Note:** Beads is a CLI tool you install once and use everywhere. You don't need to clone this repository into your project.

## 🛠 Features

* **[Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt)-Powered:** Version-controlled SQL database with cell-level merge, native branching, and built-in sync via Dolt remotes.
* **Agent-Optimized:** JSON output, dependency tracking, and auto-ready task detection.
* **Zero Conflict:** Hash-based IDs (`bd-a1b2`) prevent merge collisions in multi-agent/multi-branch workflows.
* **Compaction:** Semantic "memory decay" summarizes old closed tasks to save context window.
* **Messaging:** Message issue type with threading (`--thread`), ephemeral lifecycle, and mail delegation.
* **Graph Links:** `relates_to`, `duplicates`, `supersedes`, and `replies_to` for knowledge graphs.

## 📖 Essential Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `bd ready` | List tasks with no open blockers. |
| `bd create "Title" -p 0` | Create a P0 task. |
| `bd update <id> --claim` | Atomically claim a task (sets assignee + in_progress). |
| `bd dep add <child> <parent>` | Link tasks (blocks, related, parent-child). |
| `bd show <id>` | View task details and audit trail. |

## 🔗 Hierarchy & Workflow

Beads supports hierarchical IDs for epics:

* `bd-a3f8` (Epic)
* `bd-a3f8.1` (Task)
* `bd-a3f8.1.1` (Sub-task)

**Stealth Mode:** Run `bd init --stealth` to use Beads locally without committing files to the main repo. Perfect for personal use on shared projects. See [Git-Free Usage](#-git-free-usage) below.

**Contributor vs Maintainer:** When working on open-source projects:

* **Contributors** (forked repos): Run `bd init --contributor` to route planning issues to a separate repo (e.g., `~/.beads-planning`). Keeps experimental work out of PRs.
* **Maintainers** (write access): Beads auto-detects maintainer role via SSH URLs or HTTPS with credentials. Only need `git config beads.role maintainer` if using GitHub HTTPS without credentials but you have write access.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
brew install beads           # macOS / Linux (recommended)
npm install -g @beads/bd     # Node.js users
```

**Other methods:** [install script](docs/INSTALLING.md#quick-install-script-all-platforms) | [go install](docs/INSTALLING.md#a-note-on-go-install-capability) | [from source](docs/INSTALLING.md#build-dependencies-contributors-only) | [Windows](docs/INSTALLING.md#windows-11) | [Arch AUR](docs/INSTALLING.md#linux)

**Requirements:** macOS, Linux, Windows, or FreeBSD. See [docs/INSTALLING.md](docs/INSTALLING.md) for complete installation guide.

### Security And Verification

Before trusting any downloaded binary, verify its checksum against the release `checksums.txt`.

The install scripts verify release checksums before install. For manual installs, do this verification yourself before first run.

On macOS, `scripts/install.sh` preserves the downloaded signature by default. Local ad-hoc re-signing is explicit opt-in via `BEADS_INSTALL_RESIGN_MACOS=1`.

See [docs/ANTIVIRUS.md](docs/ANTIVIRUS.md) for Windows AV false-positive guidance and verification workflow.

## 💾 Storage Modes

Beads uses [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) as its database. Two modes
are available:

### Embedded Mode (default)

```bash
bd init
```

Dolt runs in-process — no external server needed. Data lives in
`.beads/embeddeddolt/`. Single-writer only (file locking enforced).
This is the recommended mode for most users.

### Server Mode

```bash
bd init --server
```

Connects to an external `dolt sql-server`. Data lives in `.beads/dolt/`.
Supports multiple concurrent writers. Configure the connection with flags
or environment variables:

| Flag | Env Var | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--server-host` | `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--server-port` | `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_PORT` | `3307` |
| `--server-socket` | `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_SOCKET` | (none; uses TCP) |
| `--server-user` | `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_USER` | `root` |
| | `BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD` | (none) |
| | `BEADS_DOLT_CLI_DIR` | local Dolt database path for CLI push/pull |

**Unix domain sockets:** Use `--server-socket` to connect via a Unix socket
instead of TCP. This avoids port conflicts between concurrent projects and
is useful in sandboxed environments (e.g., Claude Code) where file-level
access control is simpler than network allowlists. The Dolt server must be
started with `dolt sql-server --socket <path>`. Auto-start is not supported
in socket mode.

When `BEADS_DOLT_SERVER_MODE=1` points at a Dolt server managed outside
Beads, set `BEADS_DOLT_CLI_DIR` if `bd dolt push` / `bd dolt pull` must use
the local `dolt` CLI (for example git-protocol remotes or credentials that
only exist in the current shell). Use the actual Dolt database directory, not
the server root.

### Backup & Migration

Back up your database and migrate between modes using `bd backup`:

```bash
# Set up a backup destination and push
bd backup init /path/to/backup
bd backup sync

# Restore into a new project (any mode)
bd init           # or bd init --server
bd backup restore --force /path/to/backup
```

See [docs/DOLT.md](docs/DOLT.md#migrating-between-backends) for full
migration instructions.

## 🌐 Community Tools

See [docs/COMMUNITY_TOOLS.md](docs/COMMUNITY_TOOLS.md) for a curated list of community-built UIs, extensions, and integrations—including terminal interfaces, web UIs, editor extensions, and native apps.

## 🚀 Git-Free Usage

Beads works without git. The Dolt database is the storage backend — git
integration (hooks, repo discovery, identity) is optional.

```bash
# Initialize without git
export BEADS_DIR=/path/to/your/project/.beads
bd init --quiet --stealth

# All core commands work with zero git calls
bd create "Fix auth bug" -p 1 -t bug
bd ready --json
bd update bd-a1b2 --claim
bd prime
bd close bd-a1b2 "Fixed"
```

`BEADS_DIR` tells bd where to put the `.beads/` database directory,
bypassing git repo discovery. `--stealth` sets `no-git-ops: true` in
config, disabling all git hook installation and git operations.

This is useful for:
- **Non-git VCS** (Sapling, Jujutsu, Piper) — no `.git/` directory needed
- **Monorepos** — point `BEADS_DIR` at a specific subdirectory
- **CI/CD** — isolated task tracking without repo-level side effects
- **Evaluation/testing** — ephemeral databases in `/tmp`

For daemon mode without git, use `bd daemon start --local`
(see [PR #433](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/pull/433)).
