View the HTTP and HTTPS requests made by any linux program by running `httptap -- <command>`. For example, the following runs curl on "monasticacademy.org", which results in an HTTP status of 308 (Redirect):

```shell
$ httptap -- curl https://monasticacademy.org
---> GET https://monasticacademy.org/
<--- 308 https://monasticacademy.org/ (15 bytes)
```

Now let's try the same thing with an HTTP request from python. This time we see that python follows the redirect and gets a 200 OK response:

```shell
httptap -- python -c "import requests; requests.get('https://monasticacademy.org')"
---> GET https://monasticacademy.org/
<--- 308 https://monasticacademy.org/ (15 bytes)
---> GET https://www.monasticacademy.org/
<--- 200 https://www.monasticacademy.org/ (5796 bytes)
```

To run `httptap` you do not need to be the root user. You do not need to set up any kind of daemon or make any system-wide changes to your system. It will not create any iptables rules or change your routing table, and generally will not affect any other processes running on the same system. The `httptap` executable is a static Go binary that runs without dependencies.

Httptap only runs on linux at present. It makes use of linux-specific system calls -- in particular network namespaces -- that will unfortunately make it very difficult to port to other operating systems. If you know how httptap could be ported to other operating systems then please get in touch!

# Install pre-built binary

```shell
curl -L https://github.com/monasticacademy/httptap/releases/latest/download/httptap_linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xzf -
```

For all versions and CPU architectures see the [latest releases page](https://github.com/monasticacademy/httptap/releases/latest).

# Install with Go

```shell
go install github.com/monasticacademy/httptap@latest
```

# Quickstart

Let's run a simple test:

```shell
httptap -- curl -s https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null
---> GET https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/
<--- 302 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/ (117 bytes)
```

What happened here is that we ran `curl -s https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null` and it received a 302 redirect from the server. `httptap` printed summaries of the HTTP requests and their responses. Let's see how it changes if we tell curl to follow redirects by adding `-L`:

```shell
httptap -- curl -sL https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null
---> GET https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/
<--- 302 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/ (117 bytes)
---> GET https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/space/cbodvy/content
<--- 200 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/space/cbodvy/content (6377 bytes)
```

Now we can see that after receiving the 302 redirect, curl made an additional HTTP request to the URL to which it was redirected, which is what you expect when using `-L` with curl.

Let's see what HTTP endpoints the Google Cloud command line interface uses to list compute resources (this requires that you have gcloud installed and are signed in):

```shell
$ httptap -- gcloud compute instances list
---> POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
<--- 200 https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token (997 bytes)
---> GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/maple-public-website/aggregated/instances?alt=json&includeAllScopes=True&maxResults=500&returnPartialSuccess=True
<--- 200 https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/maple-public-website/aggregated/instances?alt=json&includeAllScopes=True&maxResults=500&returnPartialSuccess=True (19921 bytes)
NAME       ZONE        MACHINE_TYPE  PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP     STATUS
<your cloud instances listed here>
```

What happened here is that we ran `gcloud compute instances list`, which lists the compute instances that the signed-in user has on Google Cloud. The bottom two lines of output were printed by `gcloud`; the rest were printed by `httptap` and show what HTTP requests `gcloud` used to get the information it printed.

Let's see what HTTP endpoints kubectl uses in a "get all" (this requires that you have kubectl installed and are authenticated to a cluster):

```shell
$ httptap --https 443 6443 -- kubectl get all --insecure-skip-tls-verify
---> GET https://cluster:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods?limit=500 (38345 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/replicationcontrollers?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/replicationcontrollers?limit=500 (2509 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/services?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/services?limit=500 (5586 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/daemonsets?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/daemonsets?limit=500 (3052 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/deployments?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/deployments?limit=500 (7438 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/replicasets?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/replicasets?limit=500 (47211 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/statefulsets?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/statefulsets?limit=500 (1416 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/apis/autoscaling/v2/namespaces/default/horizontalpodautoscalers?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/apis/autoscaling/v2/namespaces/default/horizontalpodautoscalers?limit=500 (2668 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/apis/batch/v1/namespaces/default/cronjobs?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/apis/batch/v1/namespaces/default/cronjobs?limit=500 (3134 bytes)
---> GET https://cluster:6443/apis/batch/v1/namespaces/default/jobs?limit=500
<--- 200 https://cluster:6443/apis/batch/v1/namespaces/default/jobs?limit=500 (2052 bytes)
<ordinary kubectl output here>
```

In the above, `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` is necessary because kubectl doesn't use the httptap-generated certificate authority, and `--https 443 6443` says to treat TCP connections on ports 443 and 6443 as HTTPS connections, which is needed because my cluter's API endpoint uses port 6443.

Let's see how DNS-over-HTTP works when you use `--doh-url` with curl:

```shell
$ httptap -- curl -sL --doh-url https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null
---> POST https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
<--- 200 https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query (149 bytes)
---> POST https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
<--- 200 https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query (150 bytes)
---> GET https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/
<--- 302 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/ (117 bytes)
---> GET https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/space/cbodvy/content
<--- 200 https://buddhismforai.sutra.co/space/cbodvy/content (6377 bytes)
```

What happened here is that we told `curl` to request the url "https://buddhismforai.sutra.co", using the cloudflare DNS-over-HTTP service at `cloudflare-dns.com`. In the output we see that `curl` made 4 HTTP requests in total; the first two were DNS lookups, and then the second two were the ordinary HTTP requests for buddhismforai.sutra.co.

Let's print the contents of the DNS-over-HTTP payloads:

```shell
$ httptap --head --body -- curl -sL --doh-url https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query https://buddhismforai.sutra.co -o /dev/null
---> POST https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query
> Accept: */*
> Content-Type: application/dns-message
> Content-Length: 40
buddhismforaisutraco
<--- 200 https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query (149 bytes)
< Alt-Svc: h3=":443"; ma=86400
< Server: cloudflare
< Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 18:13:12 GMT
< Content-Type: application/dns-message
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Content-Length: 149
< Cf-Ray: 8f7290631e334211-EWR
buddhismforaisutraco�
��w�4+#G�.           <wildcardsutraco	herokudnscom�4+!�=�4+
...
```

Here the `--head` option tells httptap to print the HTTP headers, and `--body` tells it to print the raw HTTP payloads. To keep it short I'm showing just the first request/response pair.

# HAR output

You can dump the HTTP requests and responses to a HAR file like this:

```
$ httptap --dump-har out.har -- curl -Lso /dev/null https://monasticacademy.org
```

There are many HAR viewers out there that can visualize this dump file. For example here is how the above looks in the [Google HAR Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/):

![HAR Analyzer Screenshot](docs/har-screenshot.png)

Again, what you're looking at here is one HTTP request to https://monasticacademy.org that returns a 308 Redirect, followed by a second HTTP request to https://www.monasticacademy.org that return a 200 OK.

# Reaching localhost

To reach a localhost port, replace "localhost" with "host.httptap.local" or the special IP address 169.254.77.65. Traffic to these destinations will routed to localhost on your machine.

The situation here is that in linux every network namespace automatically gets its own loopback device (127.0.0.1), and these can't be shared. This means that if a process running within httptap tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:1234, it'll actually be connecting to a "different" 127.0.0.1 from another process on your machine listening on this same address and port, and you won't be able to connect.

As a workaround, the address 169.254.77.65 is hardcoded within httptap to route to 127.0.0.1.

# How it works

When you run `httptap -- <command>`, httptap runs `<command>` in an isolated network namespace, injecting a certificate authority created on-the-fly in order to decrypt HTTPS traffic. Here is the process in detail:

In linux, there is a kernel API for creating and configuring network interfaces. Conventionally, a network interface would be a physical ethernet or WiFi controller in your computer, but it is possible to create a special kind of network interface called a TUN device. A TUN device shows up to the system in the way that any network interface shows up, but any traffic written to it will be delivered to a file descriptor held by the process that created it. Httptap creates a TUN device and runs the subprocess in an environment in which all network traffic is routed through that device.

There is also a kernel API in linux for creating network namespaces. A network namespace is a list of network interfaces and routing rules. When a process is started in linux, it can be run in a specified network namespace. By default, processes run in a root network namespace that we do not want to make chagnes to because doing so would affect all network traffic on the system. Instead, we create a network namespace in which there are only two network interfaces: a loopback device (127.0.0.1) and a TUN device that delivers traffic to us. Then we run the subprocess in that namespace.

The traffic from the network device is delivered to us as raw IP packets. We must parse the IP packets as well as the inner TCP and UDP packets, and write raw IP packets back to the subprocess. This requires a software implementation of the TCP/IP protocol, which is by far the most difficult part of httptap. The TCP/IP implementation in httptap is missing many aspects of the full TCP protocol, but still works reasonably well for its purpose.

Suppose the subprocess makes an HTTP request to www.example.com. The first thing we receive is a TCP SYN packet addressed to 93.184.215.14 (the current IP address of example.com). We respond with a SYN+ACK packet with source address 93.184.215.14, though in truth the packet did not come from 93.184.215.14, but from us. Separately, we establish our own TCP connection to 93.184.215.14 using the ordinary sockets API in the linux kernel. When the subprocess sends data to 93.184.215.14 we relay it over our separate TCP connection, and vice versa for return data. This is a traditional transparent TCP proxy, and in this way we can view all data flowing to and from the subprocess, though we won't be able to decrypt HTTPS traffic without a bit more work.

When a client makes an HTTPS request, it asks the server for evidence that it is who it says it is. If the server has a certificate signed by a certificate authority, it can use that certificate to prove that it is who it says it is. The client will only accept such a certificate if it trusts the certificate authority that signed the certificate. Operating systems, web browsers, and many other pieces of software come with a list of a few hundred certificate authorities that they trust. Many of these pieces of software have ways for users to add additional certificate authorities to this list. We make use of this.

When httptap starts, it creates a certificate authority (actually a private key plus a corresponding x509 certificate), writes it to a file on the filesystem visible only to the subprocess, and sets a few environment variables -- again only visible to the subprocess being run -- that add this certificate authority to the list of trusted certificate authorities. Since the subprocess trusts this certificate authority, and httptap holds the private key for the certificate authority, it can prove to the subprocess that it is the server which which the subprocess was trying to communicate. In this way we can read the plaintext HTTP requests.

# How it was made

Httptap is part of an experiment in developing technology in the context of Buddhist monasticism. It was developed at the [Monastic Academy](https://www.monasticacademy.org) in Vermont in the US. We believe that a monastic schedule, and the practice of the Buddhist spiritual path more generally, provide ideal conditions for technological development. The way we have set things up is that we live and practice together on a bit over a hundred acres of land. In the mornings and evenings we chant and meditate together, and for about one week out of every month we run and participate in a meditation retreat. The rest of the time we work together on everything from caring for the land, maintaining the buildings, cooking, cleaning, planning, fundraising, and for the past few years developing software together. This project is a demonstration of what is possible on the software side, but of course to see the full product of our work you should come visit us.

If you're interested, we run an [AI fellowship program](https://www.monasticacademy.org/ai-fellowship), which is a funded month-to-month program where you live on the land, participate in the schedule, and do your own work during the day. We also have a 3-month [monastic training program](https://www.monasticacademy.org/train), which can lead into our long-term residential training.

For the past few years we have been recording a lecture series called [Buddhism for AI](https://buddhismforai.sutra.co). It's about our efforts to design a religion (yes, a religion) based on Buddhism for consumption directly by AI systems. We actually feel this is very important work given the world situation.

Finally, our head teacher [Soryu Forall](https://www.monasticacademy.org/teacher) published a book a few years back called [Buddhism For All](https://buddhism.net/buddhism-for-all-book/). We're working on a sequel at the moment.

# Caveats

- The process cannot listen for incoming network connections
- You need access to `/dev/net/tun`
- All ICMP echo requests will be echoed without sending any ICMP packets out to the real network
