# Pocket TTS

<img width="1446" height="622" alt="pocket-tts-logo-v2-transparent" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637b5ed6-831f-4023-9b4c-741be21ab238" />

A lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) application designed to run efficiently on CPUs.
Forget about the hassle of using GPUs and web APIs serving TTS models. With Kyutai's Pocket TTS, generating audio is just a pip install and a function call away.

Supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14. Requires PyTorch 2.5+. Does not require the gpu version of PyTorch.

Additional languages may be added in the future.

## Trying it from the website, without installing anything

Navigate to the [Kyutai website](https://kyutai.org/pocket-tts) to try it out directly in your browser. You can input text, select different voices, and generate speech without any installation.

## Trying it with the CLI

### The `generate` command
You can use pocket-tts directly from the command line. We recommend using
`uv` as it installs any dependencies on the fly in an isolated environment (uv installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer)).
You can also use `pip install pocket-tts` to install it manually.

This will generate a wav file `./tts_output.wav` saying the default text with the default voice, and display some speed statistics.
```bash
uvx pocket-tts generate
# or if you installed it manually with pip:
pocket-tts generate
```
Modify the voice with `--voice` and the text with `--text`. We provide a small catalog of voices.
Choose a pretrained language model with `--language` when running `generate`, `export-voice`, or `serve` (default: `english`). Non-english languages have also biggers 24 layers variants that are higher quality but slower. You can select them by using for example `--language italian_24l`.
The `--config` option accepts only a local YAML path for custom weights.

You can take a look at [this page](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices) which details the licenses
for each voice.

The `--voice` argument can also take a plain wav file as input for voice cloning.
You can use your own or check out our [voice repository](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices).
We recommend [cleaning the sample](https://podcast.adobe.com/en/enhance) before using it with Pocket TTS, because the audio quality of the sample is also reproduced.

Feel free to check out the [generate documentation](https://kyutai-labs.github.io/pocket-tts/CLI%20Commands/generate/) for more details and examples.
For trying multiple voices and prompts quickly, prefer using the `serve` command.

### The `serve` command

You can also run a local server to generate audio via HTTP requests.
```bash
uvx pocket-tts serve
# or if you installed it manually with pip:
pocket-tts serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to try the web interface, it's faster than the command line as the model is kept in memory between requests.

You can check out the [serve documentation](https://kyutai-labs.github.io/pocket-tts/CLI%20Commands/serve/) for more details and examples.

### The `export-voice` command

Processing an audio file (e.g., a .wav or .mp3) for voice cloning is relatively slow, but loading a safetensors file -- a voice embedding converted from an audio file -- is very fast. You can use the `export-voice` command to do this conversion. See the [export-voice documentation](https://kyutai-labs.github.io/pocket-tts/CLI%20Commands/export_voice/) for more details and examples.


## Using it as a Python library

You can try out the Python library on Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts/blob/main/docs/pocket-tts-example.ipynb).

Install the package with
```bash
pip install pocket-tts
# or
uv add pocket-tts
```

You can use this package as a simple Python library to generate audio from text.
```python
from pocket_tts import TTSModel
import scipy.io.wavfile

tts_model = TTSModel.load_model()
voice_state = tts_model.get_state_for_audio_prompt(
    "alba"  # One of the pre-made voices, see above
    # You can also use any voice file you have locally or from Hugging Face:
    # "./some_audio.wav"
    # or "hf://kyutai/tts-voices/expresso/ex01-ex02_default_001_channel2_198s.wav"
)
audio = tts_model.generate_audio(voice_state, "Hello world, this is a test.")
# Audio is a 1D torch tensor containing PCM data.
scipy.io.wavfile.write("output.wav", tts_model.sample_rate, audio.numpy())
```

You can have multiple voice states around if
you have multiple voices you want to use. `load_model()`
and `get_state_for_audio_prompt()` are relatively slow operations,
so we recommend to keep the model and voice states in memory if you can.

For faster voice loading, you can export voice states to safetensors files:
```python
from pocket_tts import TTSModel, export_model_state

model = TTSModel.load_model()

# Export a voice state for fast loading later
model_state = model.get_state_for_audio_prompt("some_voice.wav")
export_model_state(model_state, "./some_voice.safetensors")

# Later, load it quickly, this is quite fast as it's just reading the kvcache
# from disk and doesn't do any others computations.
model_state_copy = model.get_state_for_audio_prompt("./some_voice.safetensors")

audio = model.generate_audio(model_state_copy, "Hello world!")
```

You can check out the [Python API documentation](https://kyutai-labs.github.io/pocket-tts/API%20Reference/python-api/) for more details and examples.

## Unsupported features

At the moment, we do not support (but would love pull requests adding):

- [Adding silence in the text input to generate pauses.](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts/issues/6)

We tried running this TTS model on the GPU but did not observe a speedup compared to CPU execution,
notably because we use a batch size of 1 and a very small model.

## Development and local setup

We accept contributions! Feel free to open issues or pull requests on GitHub.

You can find development instructions in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. You'll also find there how to have an editable install of the package for local development.
