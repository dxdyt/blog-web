## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, your agent can recognize when you're working on a marketing task and apply the right frameworks and best practices.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills reference each other and build on shared context. The `product-marketing` skill is the foundation — every other skill checks it first to understand your product, audience, and positioning before doing anything.

## Installation

### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)

Use [npx skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to install skills directly:

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install specific skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --skill cro copywriting

# List available skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --list
```

This automatically installs to your `.agents/skills/` directory (and symlinks into `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code compatibility).

### Option 2: Claude Code Plugin

Install via Claude Code's built-in plugin system:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install all marketing skills
/plugin install marketing-skills
```

### Option 3: Clone and Copy

Clone the entire repo and copy the skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git
cp -r marketingskills/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

### Option 4: Git Submodule

Add as a submodule for easy updates:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git .agents/marketingskills
```

Then reference skills from `.agents/marketingskills/skills/`.

### Option 5: Fork and Customize

1. Fork this repository
2. Customize skills for your specific needs
3. Clone your fork into your projects

### Option 6: SkillKit (Multi-Agent)

Use [SkillKit](https://github.com/rohitg00/skillkit) to install skills across multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.):

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skillkit install coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install specific skills
npx skillkit install coreyhaines31/marketingskills --skill cro copywriting

# List available skills
npx skillkit install coreyhaines31/marketingskills --list
```

## Upgrading from v1.x to v2.0

v2.0 renames 17 skills and consolidates `page-cro` + `form-cro` into a single `cro` skill. If you installed the v1.x skills, you'll have **stale old-name folders** in your install directory after upgrading — the new skills install alongside the old ones, so you'll see both `skills/page-cro/` and `skills/cro/`, etc. Clean them up:

```bash
# From the directory where you installed the skills (e.g., .agents/skills/ or .claude/skills/)
rm -rf page-cro form-cro \
       ab-test-setup analytics-tracking aso-audit competitor-alternatives \
       email-sequence free-tool-strategy launch-strategy onboarding-cro \
       paid-ads paywall-upgrade-cro popup-cro pricing-strategy \
       product-marketing-context referral-program schema-markup \
       signup-flow-cro social-content
```

Then reinstall the v2.0 skills via your usual method (e.g., `npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills`).

### Migrate the product marketing context file

In v2.0 the context file moved from `.claude/` to `.agents/` and was renamed from `product-marketing-context.md` to `product-marketing.md`. Move your existing context file:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents
# v2.0 file (or pre-v2.0 file with new name)
mv .claude/product-marketing.md .agents/product-marketing.md 2>/dev/null
# pre-v2.0 file with legacy name
mv .claude/product-marketing-context.md .agents/product-marketing.md 2>/dev/null
```

Skills will still check `.claude/` and the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename as fallbacks, so nothing breaks if you don't migrate.

### Full rename map

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| `ab-test-setup` | `ab-testing` |
| `analytics-tracking` | `analytics` |
| `aso-audit` | `aso` |
| `competitor-alternatives` | `competitors` |
| `email-sequence` | `emails` |
| `form-cro` | merged into `cro` |
| `free-tool-strategy` | `free-tools` |
| `launch-strategy` | `launch` |
| `onboarding-cro` | `onboarding` |
| `page-cro` | `cro` |
| `paid-ads` | `ads` |
| `paywall-upgrade-cro` | `paywalls` |
| `popup-cro` | `popups` |
| `pricing-strategy` | `pricing` |
| `product-marketing-context` | `product-marketing` |
| `referral-program` | `referrals` |
| `schema-markup` | `schema` |
| `signup-flow-cro` | `signup` |
| `social-content` | `social` |

## Usage

Once installed, just ask your agent to help with marketing tasks:

```
"Help me optimize this landing page for conversions"
→ Uses cro skill

"Write homepage copy for my SaaS"
→ Uses copywriting skill

"Set up GA4 tracking for signups"
→ Uses analytics skill
