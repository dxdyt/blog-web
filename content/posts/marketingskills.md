## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, your agent can recognize when you're working on a marketing task and apply the right frameworks and best practices.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills reference each other and build on shared context. The `product-marketing-context` skill is the foundation — every other skill checks it first to understand your product, audience, and positioning before doing anything.

## Installation

### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)

Use [npx skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to install skills directly:

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install specific skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --skill page-cro copywriting

# List available skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --list
```

This automatically installs to your `.agents/skills/` directory (and symlinks into `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code compatibility).

### Option 2: Claude Code Plugin

Install via Claude Code's built-in plugin system:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install all marketing skills
/plugin install marketing-skills
```

### Option 3: Clone and Copy

Clone the entire repo and copy the skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git
cp -r marketingskills/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

### Option 4: Git Submodule

Add as a submodule for easy updates:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git .agents/marketingskills
```

Then reference skills from `.agents/marketingskills/skills/`.

### Option 5: Fork and Customize

1. Fork this repository
2. Customize skills for your specific needs
3. Clone your fork into your projects

### Option 6: SkillKit (Multi-Agent)

Use [SkillKit](https://github.com/rohitg00/skillkit) to install skills across multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.):

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skillkit install coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install specific skills
npx skillkit install coreyhaines31/marketingskills --skill page-cro copywriting

# List available skills
npx skillkit install coreyhaines31/marketingskills --list
```

## Upgrading from v1.0

Skills now use `.agents/` instead of `.claude/` for the product marketing context file. Move your existing context file:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents
mv .claude/product-marketing-context.md .agents/product-marketing-context.md
```

Skills will still check `.claude/` as a fallback, so nothing breaks if you don't.

## Usage

Once installed, just ask your agent to help with marketing tasks:

```
"Help me optimize this landing page for conversions"
→ Uses page-cro skill

"Write homepage copy for my SaaS"
→ Uses copywriting skill

"Set up GA4 tracking for signups"
→ Uses analytics-tracking skill

"Create a 5-email welcome sequence"
→ Uses email-sequence skill
```

You can also invoke skills directly:

```
/page-cro
/email-sequence
/seo-audit
```
