We provide two libraries for the broader community to customize their language models: `tinker` and `tinker-cookbook`.

- `tinker` is a training SDK for researchers and developers to fine-tune language models. You send API requests to us and we handle the complexities of distributed training.
- `tinker-cookbook` includes realistic examples of fine-tuning language models. It builds on the Tinker API and provides common abstractions to fine-tune language models.

## Installation

1. Sign up for Tinker through the [waitlist](https://thinkingmachines.ai/tinker).
2. Once you have access, create an API key from the [console](https://tinker-console.thinkingmachines.ai) and export it as environment variable `TINKER_API_KEY`.
3. Install tinker python client via `pip install tinker`
4. We recommend installing `tinker-cookbook` in a virtual env either with `conda` or `uv`. For running most examples, you can install via `pip install -e .`.

## Tinker

Refer to the [docs](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/training-sampling) to start from basics.
Here we introduce a few Tinker primitives - the basic components to fine-tune LLMs:

```python
service_client = tinker.ServiceClient()
training_client = service_client.create_lora_training_client(
  base_model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B", rank=32,
)
training_client.forward_backward(...)
training_client.optim_step(...)
training_client.save_state(...)
training_client.load_state(...)

sampling_client = training_client.save_weights_and_get_sampling_client(name="my_model")
sampling_client.sample(...)
```

See [tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_loop.py](tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_loop.py) and [tinker_cookbook/recipes/rl_loop.py](tinker_cookbook/recipes/rl_loop.py) for minimal examples of using these primitives to fine-tune LLMs.

To download the weights of any model:
```python
rest_client = service_client.create_rest_client()
future = rest_client.download_checkpoint_archive_from_tinker_path(sampling_client.model_path)
with open(f"model-checkpoint.tar.gz", "wb") as f:
    f.write(future.result())
```

### Tinker Cookbook

Besides these primitives, we also offer **Tinker Cookbook** (a.k.a. this repo), a library of a wide range of abstractions to help you customize training environments.
[`tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_basic.py`](tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_basic.py) and [`tinker_cookbook/recipes/rl_basic.py`](tinker_cookbook/recipes/rl_basic.py) contain minimal examples to configure supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

We also include a wide range of more sophisticated examples in the [`tinker_cookbook/recipes/`](tinker_cookbook/recipes/) folder:
1. **[Chat supervised learning](tinker_cookbook/recipes/chat_sl/)**: supervised fine-tuning on conversational datasets like Tulu3.
2. **[Math reasoning](tinker_cookbook/recipes/math_rl/)**: improve LLM reasoning capability by rewarding it for answering math questions correctly.
3. **[Preference learning](tinker_cookbook/recipes/preference/)**: showcase a three-stage RLHF pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning, 2) learning a reward model, 3) RL against the reward model.
4. **[Tool use](tinker_cookbook/recipes/tool_use/)**: train LLMs to better use retrieval tools to answer questions more accurately.
5. **[Prompt distillation](tinker_cookbook/recipes/prompt_distillation/)**: internalize long and complex instructions into LLMs.
6. **[Multi-Agent](tinker_cookbook/recipes/multiplayer_rl/)**: optimize LLMs to play against another LLM or themselves.

These examples are located in each subfolder, and their `README.md` files will walk you through the key implementation details, the commands to run them, and the expected performance.

### Import our utilities

Tinker cookbook includes several utilities. Here's a quick overview:
- [`renderers`](tinker_cookbook/renderers.py) converts tokens from/to structured chat message objects
- [`hyperparam_utils`](tinker_cookbook/hyperparam_utils.py) helps calculate hyperparameters suitable for LoRAs
- [`evaluation`](tinker_cookbook/eval/evaluators.py) provides abstractions for evaluating Tinker models and [`inspect_evaluation`](tinker_cookbook/eval/inspect_evaluators.py) shows how to integrate with InspectAI to make evaluating on standard benchmarks easy.
