# Microsoft Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

This repository catalogs various Microsoft implementations of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard that facilitates seamless integration between AI applications and external data sources and tools. MCP enables AI models to access the context they need to perform tasks effectively.

---

## üìò What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). It allows AI applications to connect with various data sources and tools in a consistent manner, enhancing their capabilities and flexibility. MCP follows a client-server architecture where:

- **MCP Hosts**: Applications like AI assistants or integrated development environments (IDEs) that initiate connections.
- **MCP Clients**: Connectors within the host application that maintain 1:1 connections with servers.
- **MCP Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities through the standardized MCP.

For more details, visit the [official MCP website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).
