## 🎯 Getting Started

### Option 1: npx (all platforms)

Install Scientific Agent Skills with a single command:

```bash
npx skills add K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills
```

This is the official standard approach for installing Agent Skills across **all platforms**, including **Claude Code**, **Claude Cowork**, **Codex**, **Gemini CLI**, **Cursor**, and any other agent that supports the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard.

### Option 2: GitHub CLI (`gh skill`)

If you use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (v2.90.0+), you can install skills with [`gh skill`](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-04-16-manage-agent-skills-with-github-cli/):

```bash
# Browse and install interactively
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills

# Install a specific skill directly
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills scanpy

# Target a specific agent host
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --agent cursor
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --agent claude-code
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --agent codex
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --agent gemini
```

`gh skill` automatically installs to the correct directory for your agent host and records provenance metadata for supply chain integrity.

#### Version pinning

Pin to a specific release tag or commit SHA for reproducible installs:

```bash
# Pin to a release tag
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --pin v1.0.0

# Pin to a commit SHA
gh skill install K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills --pin abc123def
```

#### Keeping skills up to date

```bash
# Check for updates interactively
gh skill update

# Update all installed skills
gh skill update --all
```

**That's it!** Your AI agent will automatically discover the skills and use them when relevant to your scientific tasks. You can also invoke any skill manually by mentioning the skill name in your prompt.

---

## ⚠️ Security Disclaimer

> **Skills can execute code and influence your coding agent's behavior. Review what you install.**

Agent Skills are powerful — they can instruct your AI agent to run arbitrary code, install packages, make network requests, and modify files on your system. A malicious or poorly written skill has the potential to steer your coding agent into harmful behavior.

We take security seriously. All contributions go through a review process, and we run LLM-based security scans (via [Cisco AI Defense Skill Scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner)) on every skill in this repository. However, as a small team with a growing number of community contributions, we cannot guarantee that every skill has been exhaustively reviewed for all possible risks.

**It is ultimately your responsibility to review the skills you install and decide which ones to trust.**

We recommend the following:

- **Do not install everything at once.** Only install the skills you actually need for your work. While installing the full collection was reasonable when K-Dense created and maintained every skill, the repository now includes many community contributions that we may not have reviewed as thoroughly.
- **Read the `SKILL.md` before installing.** Each skill's documentation describes what it does, what packages it uses, and what external services it connects to. If something looks suspicious, don't install it.
- **Check the contribution history.** Skills authored by K-Dense (`K-Dense-AI`) have been through our internal review process. Community-contributed skills have been reviewed to the best of our ability, but with limited resources.
- **Run the security scanner yourself.** Before installing third-party skills, scan them locally:
  ```bash
  uv pip install cisco-ai-skill-scanner
  skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-behavioral
  ```
- **Report anything suspicious.** If you find a skill that looks malicious or behaves unexpectedly, please [open an issue](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills/issues) immediately so we can investigate.

All skills are scanned on an approximately weekly basis, and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) is updated with the latest results. We try to address security gaps as they arise.

### Security Scanning

All skills in this repository are security-scanned using [Cisco AI Defense Skill Scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner), an open-source tool that detects prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious code patterns in Agent Skills.

If you are contributing a new skill, we recommend running the scanner locally before submitting a pull request:

```bash
uv pip install cisco-ai-skill-scanner
skill-scanner scan /path/to/your/skill --use-behavioral
```

> **Note:** A clean scan result reduces noise in review, but does not guarantee a skill is free of all risk. Contributed skills are also reviewed manually before merging.

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this free to use?**  
A: Yes! This repository is MIT licensed. However, each individual skill has its own license specified in the `license` metadata field within its `SKILL.md` file—be sure to review and comply with those terms.

**Q: Why are all skills grouped together instead of separate packages?**  
A: We believe good science in the age of AI is inherently interdisciplinary. Bundling all skills together makes it trivial for you (and your agent) to bridge across fields—e.g., combining genomics, cheminformatics, clinical data, and machine learning in one workflow—without worrying about which individual skills to install or wire together.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**  
A: The repository itself is MIT licensed, which allows commercial use. However, individual skills may have different licenses—check the `license` field in each skill's `SKILL.md` file to ensure compliance with your intended use.

**Q: Do all skills have the same license?**  
A: No. Each skill has its own license specified in the `license` metadata field within its `SKILL.md` file. These licenses may differ from the repository's MIT License. Users are responsible for reviewing and adhering to the license terms of each individual skill they use.

**Q: How often is this updated?**  
A: We regularly update skills to reflect the latest versions of packages and APIs. Major updates are announced in release notes.

**Q: Can I use this with other AI models?**  
A: The skills follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard and work with any compatible agent, including Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex.

### Installation & Setup

**Q: Do I need all the Python packages installed?**  
A: No! Only install the packages you need. Each skill specifies its requirements in its `SKILL.md` file.

**Q: What if a skill doesn't work?**  
A: First check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section. If the issue persists, file an issue on GitHub with detailed reproduction steps.

**Q: Do the skills work offline?**  
A: Database skills require internet access to query APIs. Package skills work offline once Python dependencies are installed.

### Contributing

**Q: Can I contribute my own skills?**  
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions. See the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines and best practices.

**Q: How do I report bugs or suggest features?**  
A: Open an issue on GitHub with a clear description. For bugs, include reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior.
