## Architecture

- DBeaver is written mostly on Java. However, it also uses a set of native OS-specific components for desktop UI, high performance database drivers and networking.
- Basic frameworks:
  - [OSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) platform for plugins and dependency management. Community version consists of 130+ plugins.
  - [Eclipse RCP](https://github.com/eclipse-platform/eclipse.platform.ui/blob/master/docs/Rich_Client_Platform.md) platform for rich user interface build.
  - [JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) for basic database connectivity API.
  - [JSQLParser](https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser) and [Antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) for SQL grammar and semantic parser.
- For networking and additional functionality we use wide range of open source libraries such as [SSHJ](https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj), [Apache POI](https://github.com/apache/poi), [JFreeChart](https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart), [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts), [Apache JEXL](https://github.com/apache/commons-jexl) etc.
- We separate model plugins from desktop UI plugins. This allows us to use the same set of "back-end" plugins in both DBeaver and [CloudBeaver](https://github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver).
- Dependencies: being an OSGI application we use P2 repositories for third party dependencies. For additional Maven dependencies we use our own [DBeaver P2 repo](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver-deps-ce).
