# Monad BFT

![Nightly Tests][tests-badge]

## Overview

This repository contains implementation for the Monad consensus client and JsonRpc server. Monad consensus collects transactions and produces blocks which are written to a ledger filestream. These blocks are consumed by Monad execution, which then updates the state of the blockchain. The [triedb](monad-triedb/README.md) is a database which stores block information and the blockchain state.

## Getting Started

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Using Docker

The most straightforward way to start a consensus client + an execution client + a JsonRpc server. Run the following:
1. `cd docker/single-node`
2. `nets/run.sh`

### Using Cargo

To run a Monad consensus client, follow instructions [here](monad-node/README.md).
 
To run a JsonRpc server, follow instructions [here](monad-rpc/README.md).

    D ->> PersistenceLogger: CALL push(Event)
    D ->>+ State: CALL update(Event)
    Note over State: mutate state
    State -->>- D: RETURN Vec<Command>
    D ->> E: CALL exec(Vec<Command>)
    Note over E: apply side effects
    end
```
