**MiniCPM-o** is the latest series of on-device multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) ungraded from MiniCPM-V. The models can now take image, video, text, and audio as inputs and provide high-quality text and speech outputs in an end-to-end fashion. The model series is designed for **strong performance and efficient deployment**. The most notable models in the series currently include:


- **MiniCPM-o 4.5**: 🔥🔥🔥 The latest and most capable model in the series. With a total of 9B parameters, this end-to-end model **approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash in vision, speech, and full-duplex multimodal live streaming**, making it one of the most versatile and performant models in the open-source community. The new full-duplex multimodal live streaming capability means that the output streams (speech and text), and the real-time input streams (video and audio) do not block each other. This **enables MiniCPM-o 4.5 to see, listen, and speak simultaneously** in a real-time omnimodal conversation, and perform **proactive interactions** such as proactive reminding. The improved voice mode supports bilingual real-time speech conversation in a more natural, expressive, and stable way, and also allows for voice cloning. It also advances MiniCPM-V's visual capabilities such as strong OCR capability, trustworthy behavior and multilingual support, etc. We also rollout a **high-performing llama.cpp-omni inference framework together with a WebRTC Demo**, to bring this full-duplex multimodal live streaming experience [available on local devices such as Macs](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/demo/web_demo/WebRTC_Demo/README.md).

- **MiniCPM-V 4.0**: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ An efficient model in the MiniCPM-V series. With a total of 4B parameters, the model surpasses GPT-4.1-mini-20250414 in image understanding on the OpenCompass evaluation. With its small parameter-size and efficient architecure, MiniCPM-V 4.0 is an ideal choice for on-device deployment on the phone.

## MiniCPM-o 4.5

**MiniCPM-o 4.5** is the latest and most capable model in the MiniCPM-o series. The model is built in an end-to-end fashion based on SigLip2, Whisper-medium, CosyVoice2, and Qwen3-8B with a total of 9B parameters. It exhibits a significant performance improvement, and introduces new features for full-duplex multimodal live streaming. Notable features of MiniCPM-o 4.5 include:

- 🔥 **Leading Visual Capability.**
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 achieves an average score of 77.6 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks. **With only 9B parameters, it surpasses widely used proprietary models like GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro, and approaches Gemini 2.5 Flash** for vision-language capabilities. It supports instruct and thinking modes in a single model, better covering efficiency and performance trade-offs in different user scenarios.

- 🎙 **Strong Speech Capability.** 
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 supports **bilingual real-time speech conversation with configurable voices** in English and Chinese. It features **more natural, expressive and stable speech conversation**. The model also allows for fun features such as **voice cloning and role play via a simple reference audio clip**, where the cloning performance surpasses strong TTS tools such as CosyVoice2.

- 🎬 **New Full-Duplex and Proactive Multimodal Live Streaming Capability.** 
  As a new feature, MiniCPM-o 4.5 can process real-time, continuous video and audio input streams simultaneously while generating concurrent text and speech output streams in an end-to-end fashion, without mutual blocking. This **allows MiniCPM-o 4.5 to see, listen, and speak simultaneously**, creating a fluid, real-time omnimodal conversation experience. Beyond reactive responses, the model can also perform **proactive interaction**, such as initiating reminders or comments based on its continuous understanding of the live scene. 

- 💪 **Strong OCR Capability, Efficiency and Others.**
Advancing popular visual capabilities from MiniCPM-V series, MiniCPM-o 4.5 can process **high-resolution images** (up to 1.8 million pixels) and **high-FPS videos** (up to 10fps) in any aspect ratio efficiently. It achieves **state-of-the-art peformance for end-to-end English document parsing** on OmniDocBench, outperforming proprietary models such as Gemini-3 Flash and GPT-5, and specialized tools such as DeepSeek-OCR 2. It also features **trustworthy behaviors**, matching Gemini 2.5 Flash on MMHal-Bench, and supports **multilingual capabilities** on more than 30 languages.

-  💫  **Easy Usage.**
  MiniCPM-o 4.5 can be easily used in various ways: (1) [llama.cpp](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/llama.cpp/minicpm-o4_5_llamacpp.md) and [Ollama](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/ollama/minicpm-o4_5_ollama.md) support for efficient CPU inference on local devices, (2) [int4](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/quantization/awq/minicpm-o4_5_awq_quantize.md) and [GGUF](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/quantization/gguf/minicpm-o4_5_gguf_quantize.md) format quantized models in 16 sizes, (3) [vLLM](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/vllm/minicpm-o4_5_vllm.md) and [SGLang](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/deployment/sglang/MiniCPM-o4_5_sglang.md) support for high-throughput and memory-efficient inference, (4) [FlagOS](#flagos) support for the unified multi-chip backend plugin, (5) fine-tuning on new domains and tasks with [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/finetune/llama-factory/finetune_llamafactory.md), and (6) online web demo on [server](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/demo/web_demo/gradio/README_o45.md). We also rollout a high-performing [llama.cpp-omni](https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp-omni) inference framework together with a [WebRTC Demo](https://minicpm-omni.openbmb.cn/), which **enables the full-duplex multimodal live streaming experience on local devices** such as [PCs](https://github.com/tc-mb/llama.cpp-omni/blob/master/README.md) (e.g., on a MacBook).

**Model Architecture.**
- **End-to-end Omni-modal Architecture.** The modality encoders/decoders and LLM are densely connected via hidden states in an end-to-end fashion. This enables better information flow and control, and also facilitates full exploitation of rich multimodal knowledge during training.
- **Full-Duplex Omni-modal Live Streaming Mechanism.** (1) We turn the offline modality encoder/decoders into online and full-duplex ones for streaming inputs/outputs. The speech token decoder models text and speech tokens in an interleaved fashion to support full-duplex speech generation (i.e., sync timely with new input). This also facilitates more stable long speech generation (e.g., > 1min).
(2) **We sync all the input and output streams on timeline in milliseconds**, which are jointly modeled by a time-division multiplexing (TDM) mechanism for omni-modality streaming processing in the LLM backbone. It divides parallel omni-modality streams into sequential info groups within small periodic time slices.
- **Proactive Interaction Mechanism.** The LLM continuously monitors the input video and audio streams, and decides at a frequency of 1Hz to speak or not. This high decision-making frequency together with full-duplex nature are curcial to enable the proactive interaction capability.
- **Configurable Speech Modeling Design.** We inherent the multimodal system prompt design of MiniCPM-o 2.6, which includes a traditional text system prompt, and a new audio system prompt to determine the assistant voice. This enables cloning new voices and role play in inference time for speech conversation.

## MiniCPM-V 4.0

**MiniCPM-V 4.0** is an efficient model in the MiniCPM-V series. The model is built based on SigLIP2-400M and MiniCPM4-3B with a total of 4.1B parameters. It inherits the strong single-image, multi-image and video understanding performance of MiniCPM-V 2.6 with largely improved efficiency. Notable features of MiniCPM-V 4.0 include:

- 🔥 **Leading Visual Capability.**
   With only 4.1B parameters, MiniCPM-V 4.0 achieves an average score of 69.0 on OpenCompass, a comprehensive evaluation of 8 popular benchmarks, **outperforming GPT-4.1-mini-20250414, MiniCPM-V 2.6 (8.1B params, OpenCompass 65.2) and Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct (3.8B params, OpenCompass 64.5)**. It also shows good performance in multi-image understanding and video understanding.

- 🚀 **Superior Efficiency.**
  Designed for on-device deployment, MiniCPM-V 4.0 runs smoothly on end devices. For example, it devlivers **less than 2s first token delay and more than 17 token/s decoding on iPhone 16 Pro Max**, without heating problems. It also shows superior throughput under concurrent requests.

-  💫  **Easy Usage.**
  MiniCPM-V 4.0 can be easily used in various ways including **llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, SGLang, LLaMA-Factory and local web demo** etc. We also open-source iOS App that can run on iPhone and iPad. Get started easily with our well-structured [Cookbook](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook), featuring detailed instructions and practical examples.

## Local Interactive Demo


We provide [ready-to-run guidance](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook/blob/main/demo/web_demo/WebRTC_Demo/README.md) to access the **low-latency full-duplex communication** directly **on your own Mac** using our new official Docker image.


## Inference with Transformers

Inference using Hugging Face Transformers on NVIDIA GPUs. Please ensure `transformers==4.51.0` is installed, as other versions may have compatibility issues (under investigation). Requirements tested on Python 3.10:

- Without TTS or streaming inference:
```bash
pip install "transformers==4.51.0" accelerate "torch>=2.3.0,<=2.8.0" "torchaudio<=2.8.0" "minicpmo-utils>=1.0.2"
```

- With TTS or streaming inference:
```bash
pip install "transformers==4.51.0" accelerate "torch>=2.3.0,<=2.8.0" "torchaudio<=2.8.0" "minicpmo-utils[all]>=1.0.2"
```

#### Mimick <!-- omit in toc -->

The `Mimick` task evaluates a model's end-to-end speech modeling capability. The model takes audio input, transcribes it, and reconstructs the original audio with high fidelity, preserving detailed acoustic, paralinguistic, and semantic information. Higher similarity between the reconstructed and original audio indicates stronger end-to-end speech modeling capability.

### Structured Content Input

<details>
<summary>Click to show structured content input details.</summary>

The `chat` method accepts message content in two formats:

**Native format** – pass Python objects directly:
```python
msgs = [{"role": "user", "content": [pil_image, audio_ndarray, "Describe this."]}]
```

**OpenAI-compatible format** – use structured dictionaries:
```python
msgs = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "/path/to/image.jpg"}},
            {"type": "audio_url", "audio_url": {"url": "/path/to/audio.wav"}},
            {"type": "video_url", "video_url": {"url": "/path/to/video.mp4", "use_audio": True}},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this."}
        ]
    }
]
```

**Supported types:**

| Type | Input | Converts to |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `text` | `{"type": "text", "text": "..."}` | `str` |
| `image_url` | `{"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "..."}}` | `PIL.Image` |
| `audio_url` | `{"type": "audio_url", "audio_url": {"url": "..."}}` | `np.ndarray` (16kHz mono) |
| `video_url` | `{"type": "video_url", "video_url": {"url": "...", "stack_frames": 1, "use_audio": True}}` | `List[Image, ndarray, ...]` |

- **URL sources**: local file paths or `http://`/`https://` URLs
- **Mixed formats**: native objects and structured dicts can be combined in the same content list

## Supported Frameworks

### FlagOS

To enable large-scale deployment across different AI chips, Beijing Zhiyuan Research Institute, together with numerous research institutions, chip manufacturers, system vendors, and algorithm and software organizations both domestically and internationally, jointly initiated and established the FlagOS Open Source Community.

The FlagOS community is dedicated to building a unified, open-source system software stack for various AI chips, encompassing core open-source projects such as a large-scale operator library, a unified AI compiler, parallel training and inference frameworks, and a unified communication library. It aims to create an open technology ecosystem connecting the “model-system-chip” layers. By enabling “develop once, deploy across chips”, FlagOS unlocks the computational potential of hardware, breaks down the ecosystem silos between different chip software stacks, and effectively reduces migration costs for developers. The FlagOS community fosters an AI hardware and software ecosystem, overcomes single-vendor closed-source monopolies, promotes widespread deployment of AI hardware technologies, and is committed to rooted in China while embracing global collaboration.

## Limitations
As an experimental trial, we find MiniCPM-o 4.5 has notable limitations worth further investigation and improvement.
- **Foundation Capability.** The full-duplex omni-modality live streaminig capability still needs improvement in its foundation capability.
- **Unstable Speech Output in Omni Mode.** Speech synthesis can mispronounce characters in full-duplex omni-modal live streaminig mode.
- **Mixed Language.** The model can sometimes respond with mixed English and Chinese in speech and omni mode.
- **High-latency on Web Demo.** Users may experience unusual high-latency or even miss part of model output fragments when using our web demo hosted on overseas servers. We recommend deploying the demo locally or with good network connections.
