    ⭐️ The World's First Vibe Workflow Platform for Non-technical Creators ⭐️ <br>
</h1>

</div>

Refly.AI is the world's first vibe workflow platform that empowers non-technical creators to build, share and monetize powerful AI automation workflows through simple prompts and a visual canvas - no coding required.

- N8N for non-technical: Build workflows as easily as assembling Lego bricks. Refly.ai empowers non-technical creators to eliminate repetitive tasks without technical barriers.
- Canva for workflow: Just as Canva democratized design, Refly.ai democratizes workflow creation—making it simple for everyone to build and share automations.

## ✨ Key Features

### Intervenable Agent: Eliminates unpredictable "black box" executions

- **Visualized Execution**: Every step of the workflow is clearly visible on the canvas. Allows for easy review, understanding, and debugging of the automation process.
- **Real-time Intervention**: Users can pause, review, modify, or restart the Agent at any point during execution. Eliminates the frustration of unstable, irreversible, or unoptimizable "black box" executions.

### Minimalist Workflow Tool:  Orchestrate not nodes, but pre-packaged & powerful Agents

- Forget tedious configuration. In Refly.ai, every node is a powerful, ready-to-use Agent. All you need to do is assign tasks and connect. Refly.ai does in minutes with two nodes what n8n takes hours and ten or more nodes to complete.

### Workflow Copilot: Turn your words into complex automations

- Describe a task, and the Refly copilot instantly crafts, modifies, and debugs complex automations directly in your canvas. Even multi-step workflows can be built in seconds.

### Workflow Marketplace: One-Click Publishing,Monetize your expertise

- **One-click publishing**: Users can easily turn their workflows into shareable AI Apps and publish them to the workflow marketplace.
- **Monetize your expertise**: Creators get paid every time users run their workflows, making your experience and creations more valuable than ever.
