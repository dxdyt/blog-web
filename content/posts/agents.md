# Claude Code Plugins: Orchestration and Automation

> **⚡ Updated for Sonnet 4.5 & Haiku 4.5** — All agents optimized for latest models with hybrid orchestration
>
> **🎯 Agent Skills Enabled** — 47 specialized skills extend Claude's capabilities across plugins with progressive disclosure

A comprehensive production-ready system combining **85 specialized AI agents**, **15 multi-agent workflow orchestrators**, **47 agent skills**, and **44 development tools** organized into **63 focused, single-purpose plugins** for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).

## Overview

This unified repository provides everything needed for intelligent automation and multi-agent orchestration across modern software development:

- **63 Focused Plugins** - Granular, single-purpose plugins optimized for minimal token usage and composability
- **85 Specialized Agents** - Domain experts with deep knowledge across architecture, languages, infrastructure, quality, data/AI, documentation, business operations, and SEO
- **47 Agent Skills** - Modular knowledge packages with progressive disclosure for specialized expertise
- **15 Workflow Orchestrators** - Multi-agent coordination systems for complex operations like full-stack development, security hardening, ML pipelines, and incident response
- **44 Development Tools** - Optimized utilities including project scaffolding, security scanning, test automation, and infrastructure setup

### Key Features

- **Granular Plugin Architecture**: 63 focused plugins optimized for minimal token usage
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: 44 development tools including test generation, scaffolding, and security scanning
- **100% Agent Coverage**: All plugins include specialized agents
- **Agent Skills**: 47 specialized skills following for progressive disclosure and token efficiency
- **Clear Organization**: 23 categories with 1-6 plugins each for easy discovery
- **Efficient Design**: Average 3.4 components per plugin (follows Anthropic's 2-8 pattern)

### How It Works

Each plugin is completely isolated with its own agents, commands, and skills:

- **Install only what you need** - Each plugin loads only its specific agents, commands, and skills
- **Minimal token usage** - No unnecessary resources loaded into context
- **Mix and match** - Compose multiple plugins for complex workflows
- **Clear boundaries** - Each plugin has a single, focused purpose
- **Progressive disclosure** - Skills load knowledge only when activated

**Example**: Installing `python-development` loads 3 Python agents, 1 scaffolding tool, and makes 5 skills available (~300 tokens), not the entire marketplace.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
```

This makes all 63 plugins available for installation, but **does not load any agents or tools** into your context.

### Step 2: Install Plugins

Browse available plugins:

```bash
/plugin
```

Install the plugins you need:

```bash
# Essential development plugins
/plugin install python-development          # Python with 5 specialized skills
/plugin install javascript-typescript       # JS/TS with 4 specialized skills
/plugin install backend-development         # Backend APIs with 3 architecture skills

# Infrastructure & operations
/plugin install kubernetes-operations       # K8s with 4 deployment skills
/plugin install cloud-infrastructure        # AWS/Azure/GCP with 4 cloud skills

# Security & quality
/plugin install security-scanning           # SAST with security skill
/plugin install code-review-ai             # AI-powered code review

# Full-stack orchestration
/plugin install full-stack-orchestration   # Multi-agent workflows
```

Each installed plugin loads **only its specific agents, commands, and skills** into Claude's context.

### Hybrid Model Orchestration

Strategic model assignment for optimal performance and cost:
- **47 Haiku agents** - Fast execution for deterministic tasks
- **97 Sonnet agents** - Complex reasoning and architecture

Orchestration patterns combine models for efficiency:
```
Sonnet (planning) → Haiku (execution) → Sonnet (review)
```
