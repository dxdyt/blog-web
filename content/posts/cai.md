## Motivation
### :bust_in_silhouette: Why CAI?
The cybersecurity landscape is undergoing a dramatic transformation as AI becomes increasingly integrated into security operations. **We predict that by 2028, AI-powered security testing tools will outnumber human pentesters**. This shift represents a fundamental change in how we approach cybersecurity challenges. *AI is not just another tool - it's becoming essential for addressing complex security vulnerabilities and staying ahead of sophisticated threats. As organizations face more advanced cyber attacks, AI-enhanced security testing will be crucial for maintaining robust defenses.*

This work builds upon prior efforts[^4] and similarly, we believe that democratizing access to advanced cybersecurity AI tools is vital for the entire security community. That's why we're releasing Cybersecurity AI (`CAI`) as an open source framework. Our goal is to empower security researchers, ethical hackers, and organizations to build and deploy powerful AI-driven security tools. By making these capabilities openly available, we aim to level the playing field and ensure that cutting-edge security AI technology isn't limited to well-funded private companies or state actors.

Bug Bounty programs have become a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, providing a crucial mechanism for organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities in their systems before they can be exploited. These programs have proven highly effective at securing both public and private infrastructure, with researchers discovering critical vulnerabilities that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. CAI is specifically designed to enhance these efforts by providing a lightweight, ergonomic framework for building specialized AI agents that can assist in various aspects of Bug Bounty hunting - from initial reconnaissance to vulnerability validation and reporting. Our framework aims to augment human expertise with AI capabilities, helping researchers work more efficiently and thoroughly in their quest to make digital systems more secure.

### Ethical principles behind CAI

You might be wondering if releasing CAI *in-the-wild* given its capabilities and security implications is ethical. Our decision to open-source this framework is guided by two core ethical principles:

1. **Democratizing Cybersecurity AI**: We believe that advanced cybersecurity AI tools should be accessible to the entire security community, not just well-funded private companies or state actors. By releasing CAI as an open source framework, we aim to empower security researchers, ethical hackers, and organizations to build and deploy powerful AI-driven security tools, leveling the playing field in cybersecurity.

2. **Transparency in AI Security Capabilities**: Based on our research results, understanding of the technology, and dissection of top technical reports, we argue that current LLM vendors are undermining their cybersecurity capabilities. This is extremely dangerous and misleading. By developing CAI openly, we provide a transparent benchmark of what AI systems can actually do in cybersecurity contexts, enabling more informed decisions about security postures.

CAI is built on the following core principles:
- **Cybersecurity oriented AI framework**: CAI is specifically designed for cybersecurity use cases, aiming at semi- and fully-automating offensive and defensive security tasks.
- **Open source, free for research**: CAI is open source and free for research purposes. We aim at democratizing access to AI and Cybersecurity. For professional or commercial use, including on-premise deployments, dedicated technical support and custom extensions [reach out](mailto:research@aliasrobotics.com) to obtain a license.
- **Lightweight**: CAI is designed to be fast, and easy to use.
- **Modular and agent-centric design**: CAI operates on the basis of agents and agentic patterns, which allows flexibility and scalability. You can easily add the most suitable agents and pattern for your cybersecuritytarget case.
- **Tool-integration**: CAI integrates already built-in tools, and allows the user to integrate their own tools with their own logic easily.
- **Logging and tracing integrated**: using [`phoenix`](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix), the open source tracing and logging tool for LLMs. This provides the user with a detailed traceability of the agents and their execution.
- **Multi-Model Support**: more than 300 supported and empowered by [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm). The most popular providers:
  - **Anthropic**: `Claude 3.7`, `Claude 3.5`, `Claude 3`, `Claude 3 Opus`
  - **OpenAI**: `O1`, `O1 Mini`, `O3 Mini`, `GPT-4o`, `GPT-4.5 Preview`
  - **DeepSeek**: `DeepSeek V3`, `DeepSeek R1`
  - **Ollama**: `Qwen2.5 72B`, `Qwen2.5 14B`, etc


### Closed-source alternatives
Cybersecurity AI is a critical field, yet many groups are misguidedly pursuing it through closed-source methods for pure economic return, leveraging similar techniques and building upon existing closed-source (*often third-party owned*) models. This approach not only squanders valuable engineering resources but also represents an economic waste and results in redundant efforts, as they often end up reinventing the wheel. Here are some of the closed-source initiatives we keep track of and attempting to leverage genAI and agentic frameworks in cybersecurity AI:

### Android

We recommend having at least 8 GB of RAM:

1. First of all, install userland https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula&hl=es

2. Install Kali minimal in basic options (for free). [Or any other kali option if preferred]

3. Update apt keys like in this example: https://superuser.com/questions/1644520/apt-get-update-issue-in-kali, inside UserLand's Kali terminal execute

```bash
# Get new apt keys
wget http://http.kali.org/kali/pool/main/k/kali-archive-keyring/kali-archive-keyring_2024.1_all.deb

# Install new apt keys
sudo dpkg -i kali-archive-keyring_2024.1_all.deb && rm kali-archive-keyring_2024.1_all.deb

# Update APT repository
sudo apt-get update

# CAI requieres python 3.12, lets install it (CAI for kali in Android)
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git python3-pip build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libsqlite3-dev wget libbz2-dev pkg-config
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.4/Python-3.12.4.tar.xz
tar xf Python-3.12.4.tar.xz
cd ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall # This command takes long to execute

# Clone CAI's source code
git clone https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai && cd cai

# Create virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv cai_env

# Install the package from the local directory
source cai_env/bin/activate && pip3 install -e .

# Generate a .env file and set up
cp .env.example .env  # edit here your keys/models

# Launch CAI
cai
```


### :nut_and_bolt: Setup `.env` file

CAI leverages the `.env` file to load configuration at launch. To facilitate the setup, the repo provides an exemplary [`.env.example`](.env.example) file provides a template for configuring CAI's setup and your LLM API keys to work with desired LLM models.

:warning: Important:

CAI does NOT provide API keys for any model by default. Don't ask us to provide keys, use your own or host your own models.


:warning: Note:

The OPENAI_API_KEY must not be left blank. It should contain either "sk-123" (as a placeholder) or your actual API key. See https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/issues/27.

:warning: Note:

If you are using alias0 model, make sure that CAI is >0.4.0 version and here you have an .env example to be able to use it.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-1234"
OLLAMA=""
ALIAS_API_KEY="<sk-your-key>"  # note, add yours
CAI_STEAM=False
```

### 🔹 Custom OpenAI Base URL Support

CAI supports configuring a custom OpenAI API base URL via the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` environment variable. This allows users to redirect API calls to a custom endpoint, such as a proxy or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible service.

Example `.env` entry configuration:
```
OLLAMA_API_BASE="https://custom-openai-proxy.com/v1"
```

Or directly from the command line:
```bash
OLLAMA_API_BASE="https://custom-openai-proxy.com/v1" cai
```


## :triangular_ruler: Architecture:

CAI focuses on making cybersecurity agent **coordination** and **execution** lightweight, highly controllable, and useful for humans. To do so it builds upon 8 pillars: `Agent`s, `Tools`, `Handoffs`, `Patterns`, `Turns`, `Tracing`, `Guardrails` and `HITL`.

### 🔹 Agent

At its core, CAI abstracts its cybersecurity behavior via `Agents` and agentic `Patterns`. An Agent in *an intelligent system that interacts with some environment*. More technically, within CAI we embrace a robotics-centric definition wherein an agent is anything that can be viewed as a system perceiving its environment through sensors, reasoning about its goals and and acting accordingly upon that environment through actuators (*adapted* from Russel & Norvig, AI: A Modern Approach). In cybersecurity, an `Agent` interacts with systems and networks, using peripherals and network interfaces as sensors, reasons accordingly and then executes network actions as if actuators. Correspondingly, in CAI, `Agent`s implement the `ReACT` (Reasoning and Action) agent model[^3]. For more information, see the [example here](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/blob/main/examples/basic/hello_world.py) for the full execution code, and refer to this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/blob/main/fluency/my-first-hack/my_first_hack.ipynb) for a tutorial on how to use it.

```python
from cai.sdk.agents import Agent, Runner, OpenAIChatCompletionsModel

import os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

agent = Agent(
      name="Custom Agent",
      instructions="""You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader""",
      model=OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
          model=os.getenv('CAI_MODEL', "openai/gpt-4o"),
          openai_client=AsyncOpenAI(),
          )
      )

message = "Tell me about recursion in programming."
result = await Runner.run(agent, message)
```

### 🔹 Tools

`Tools` let cybersecurity agents take actions by providing interfaces to execute system commands, run security scans, analyze vulnerabilities, and interact with target systems and APIs - they are the core capabilities that enable CAI agents to perform security tasks effectively; in CAI, tools include built-in cybersecurity utilities (like LinuxCmd for command execution, WebSearch for OSINT gathering, Code for dynamic script execution, and SSHTunnel for secure remote access), function calling mechanisms that allow integration of any Python function as a security tool, and agent-as-tool functionality that enables specialized security agents (such as reconnaissance or exploit agents) to be used by other agents, creating powerful collaborative security workflows without requiring formal handoffs between agents. For more information, please refer to the [example here](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/blob/main/examples/basic/tools.py) for the complete configuration of custom functions.

```python
from cai.sdk.agents import Agent, Runner, OpenAIChatCompletionsModel
from cai.tools.reconnaissance.exec_code import execute_code
from cai.tools.reconnaissance.generic_linux_command import generic_linux_command

import os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

agent = Agent(
      name="Custom Agent",
      instructions="""You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader""",
      tools= [
        generic_linux_command,
        execute_code
      ],
      model=OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
          model=os.getenv('CAI_MODEL', "openai/gpt-4o"),
          openai_client=AsyncOpenAI(),
          )
      )

message = "Tell me about recursion in programming."
result = await Runner.run(agent, message)
```


You may find different [tools](tools). They are grouped in 6 major categories inspired by the security kill chain [^2]:

1. Reconnaissance and weaponization - *reconnaissance*  (crypto, listing, etc)
2. Exploitation - *exploitation*
3. Privilege escalation - *escalation*
4. Lateral movement - *lateral*
5. Data exfiltration - *exfiltration*
6. Command and control - *control*


### 🔹 Handoffs

`Handoffs` allow an `Agent` to delegate tasks to another agent, which is crucial in cybersecurity operations where specialized expertise is needed for different phases of an engagement. In our framework, `Handoffs` are implemented as tools for the LLM, where a **handoff/transfer function** like `transfer_to_flag_discriminator` enables the `ctf_agent` to pass control to the `flag_discriminator_agent` once it believes it has found the flag. This creates a security validation chain where the first agent handles exploitation and flag discovery, while the second agent specializes in flag verification, ensuring proper segregation of duties and leveraging specialized capabilities of different models for distinct security tasks. For more information, please refer to the [example here](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/blob/main/examples/cai/agent_patterns/handoffs.py) for the full execution code.


```python
from cai.sdk.agents import function_tool
from cai.tools.common import run_command
from cai.sdk.agents import Agent, OpenAIChatCompletionsModel, HandoffInputData, Runner, function_tool, handoff, trace
from cai.sdk.agents.extensions import handoff_filters

import os
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

@function_tool
def execute_cli_command(command: str) -> str:
    return run_command(command)

flag_discriminator = Agent(
    name="Flag discriminator",
    description="Agent focused on extracting the flag from the output",
    instructions="You are an agent tailored to extract the flag from a given output.",
    model=OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
        model=os.getenv('CAI_MODEL', "qwen2.5:14b"),
        openai_client=AsyncOpenAI(),
    ) 
)

ctf_agent = Agent(
    name="CTF agent",
    description="Agent focused on conquering security challenges",
    instructions="You are a Cybersecurity expert Leader facing a CTF",
    tools=[
        execute_cli_command,
    ],
    model=OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
        model= os.getenv('CAI_MODEL', "qwen2.5:14b"),
        openai_client=AsyncOpenAI(),
    ), 
    handoffs = [flag_discriminator]
)
```

### 🔹 Patterns

An agentic `Pattern` is a *structured design paradigm* in artificial intelligence systems where autonomous or semi-autonomous agents operate within a defined *interaction framework* (the pattern) to achieve a goal. These `Patterns` specify the organization, coordination, and communication
methods among agents, guiding decision-making, task execution, and delegation.

An agentic pattern (`AP`) can be formally defined as a tuple:

\\[
AP = (A, H, D, C, E)
\\]

wherein:

- **\\(A\\) (Agents):** A set of autonomous entities, \\( A = \\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\} \\), each with defined roles, capabilities, and internal states.
- **\\(H\\) (Handoffs):** A function \\( H: A \times T \to A \\) that governs how tasks \\( T \\) are transferred between agents based on predefined logic (e.g., rules, negotiation, bidding).
- **\\(D\\) (Decision Mechanism):** A decision function \\( D: S \to A \\) where \\( S \\) represents system states, and \\( D \\) determines which agent takes action at any given time.
- **\\(C\\) (Communication Protocol):** A messaging function \\( C: A \times A \to M \\), where \\( M \\) is a message space, defining how agents share information.
- **\\(E\\) (Execution Model):** A function \\( E: A \times I \to O \\) where \\( I \\) is the input space and \\( O \\) is the output space, defining how agents perform tasks.

When building `Patterns`, we generall y classify them among one of the following categories, though others exist:

| **Agentic** `Pattern` **categories** | **Description** |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| `Swarm` (Decentralized) | Agents share tasks and self-assign responsibilities without a central orchestrator. Handoffs occur dynamically. *An example of a peer-to-peer agentic pattern is the `CTF Agentic Pattern`, which involves a team of agents working together to solve a CTF challenge with dynamic handoffs.* |
| `Hierarchical` | A top-level agent (e.g., "PlannerAgent") assigns tasks via structured handoffs to specialized sub-agents. Alternatively, the structure of the agents is harcoded into the agentic pattern with pre-defined handoffs. |
| `Chain-of-Thought` (Sequential Workflow) | A structured pipeline where Agent A produces an output, hands it to Agent B for reuse or refinement, and so on. Handoffs follow a linear sequence. *An example of a chain-of-thought agentic pattern is the `ReasonerAgent`, which involves a Reasoning-type LLM that provides context to the main agent to solve a CTF challenge with a linear sequence.*[^1] |
| `Auction-Based` (Competitive Allocation) | Agents "bid" on tasks based on priority, capability, or cost. A decision agent evaluates bids and hands off tasks to the best-fit agent. |
| `Recursive` | A single agent continuously refines its own output, treating itself as both executor and evaluator, with handoffs (internal or external) to itself. *An example of a recursive agentic pattern is the `CodeAgent` (when used as a recursive agent), which continuously refines its own output by executing code and updating its own instructions.* |

For more information and examples of common agentic patterns, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/cai/blob/main/examples/agent_patterns/README.md).



### 🔹 Turns and Interactions
During the agentic flow (conversation), we distinguish between **interactions** and **turns**.

- **Interactions** are sequential exchanges between one or multiple agents. Each agent executing its logic corresponds with one *interaction*. Since an `Agent` in CAI generally implements the `ReACT` agent model[^3], each *interaction* consists of 1) a reasoning step via an LLM inference and 2) act by calling zero-to-n `Tools`. This is defined in`process_interaction()` in [core.py](cai/core.py).
- **Turns**: A turn represents a cycle of one ore more **interactions** which finishes when the `Agent` (or `Pattern`) executing returns `None`, judging there're no further actions to undertake. This is defined in `run()`, see [core.py](cai/core.py).


> [!NOTE]
> CAI Agents are not related to Assistants in the Assistants API. They are named similarly for convenience, but are otherwise completely unrelated. CAI is entirely powered by the Chat Completions API and is hence stateless between calls.


### 🔹 Tracing

CAI implements AI observability by adopting the OpenTelemetry standard and to do so, it leverages [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) which provides comprehensive tracing capabilities through OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation, allowing you to monitor and analyze your security operations in real-time. This integration enables detailed visibility into agent interactions, tool usage, and attack vectors throughout penetration testing workflows, making it easier to debug complex exploitation chains, track vulnerability discovery processes, and optimize agent performance for more effective security assessments.

![](media/tracing.png)

### 🔹 Guardrails

`Guardrails` provide a critical security layer for CAI agents, protecting against prompt injection attacks and preventing execution of dangerous commands. These guardrails run in parallel to agents, validating both input and output to ensure safe operation. The framework includes:

- **Input Guardrails**: Detect and block prompt injection attempts before they reach agents, using pattern matching, Unicode homograph detection, and AI-powered analysis
- **Output Guardrails**: Validate agent outputs before execution, preventing dangerous commands like reverse shells, fork bombs, or data exfiltration  
- **Multi-layered Defense**: Protection at input, processing, and execution stages with tool-level validation
- **Base64/Base32 Aware**: Automatically decodes and analyzes encoded payloads to detect hidden malicious commands
- **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled via `CAI_GUARDRAILS` environment variable

For detailed implementation, see [docs/guardrails.md](docs/guardrails.md) and [docs/cai_prompt_injection.md](docs/cai_prompt_injection.md).

```

CAI delivers a framework for building Cybersecurity AIs with a strong emphasis on *semi-autonomous* operation, as the reality is that **fully-autonomous** cybersecurity systems remain premature and face significant challenges when tackling complex tasks. While CAI explores autonomous capabilities, we recognize that effective security operations still require human teleoperation providing expertise, judgment, and oversight in the security process.

Accordingly, the Human-In-The-Loop (`HITL`) module is a core design principle of CAI, acknowledging that human intervention and teleoperation are essential components of responsible security testing. Through the `cli.py` interface, users can seamlessly interact with agents at any point during execution by simply pressing `Ctrl+C`. This is implemented across [core.py](cai/core.py) and also in the REPL abstractions [REPL](cai/repl).

CAI>
```

That should initialize CAI and provide a prompt to execute any security task you want to perform. The navigation bar at the bottom displays important system information. This information helps you understand your environment while working with CAI.

Here's a quick [demo video](https://asciinema.org/a/zm7wS5DA2o0S9pu1Tb44pnlvy) to help you get started with CAI. We'll walk through the basic steps — from launching the tool to running your first AI-powered task in the terminal. Whether you're a beginner or just curious, this guide will show you how easy it is to begin using CAI.

From here on, type on `CAI` and start your security exercise. Best way to learn is by example:

### Environment Variables
For using private models, you are given a [`.env.example`](.env.example) file. Copy it and rename it as `.env`. Fill in your corresponding API keys, and you are ready to use CAI.
 <details>
<summary>List of Environment Variables</summary>

### OpenRouter Integration

The Cybersecurity AI (CAI) platform offers seamless integration with OpenRouter, a unified interface for Large Language Models (LLMs). This integration is crucial for users who wish to leverage advanced AI capabilities in their cybersecurity tasks. OpenRouter acts as a bridge, allowing CAI to communicate with various LLMs, thereby enhancing the flexibility and power of the AI agents used within CAI.

To enable OpenRouter support in CAI, you need to configure your environment by adding specific entries to your `.env` file. This setup ensures that CAI can interact with the OpenRouter API, facilitating the use of sophisticated models like Meta-LLaMA. Here’s how you can configure it:

```bash
CAI_AGENT_TYPE=redteam_agent
CAI_MODEL=openrouter/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<sk-your-key>  # note, add yours
OPENROUTER_API_BASE=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

### Azure OpenAI

The Cybersecurity AI (CAI) platform integrates seamlessly with Azure OpenAI, enabling organizations to run CAI against enterprise-hosted models (e.g., gpt-4o). This pathway is ideal for teams that must operate within Azure governance while leveraging advanced model capabilities.
To enable Azure OpenAI support in CAI, configure your environment by adding the following entries to your .env. This ensures CAI can reach your Azure deployment endpoint and authenticate correctly.

```bash
CAI_AGENT_TYPE=redteam_agent
CAI_MODEL=azure/<model-name-deployed>
# Required: keep non-empty even when using Azure
OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy
# Azure credentials and endpoint
AZURE_API_KEY=<your-azure-openai-key>
AZURE_API_BASE=https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<deployment-name>/chat/completions?api-version=2025-01-01-preview
```


### MCP

CAI supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for integrating external tools and services with AI agents. MCP is supported via two transport mechanisms:

1. **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** - For web-based servers that push updates over HTTP connections:
```bash
CAI>/mcp load http://localhost:9876/sse burp
```

2. **STDIO (Standard Input/Output)** - For local inter-process communication:
```bash
CAI>/mcp load stdio myserver python mcp_server.py
```

Once connected, you can add the MCP tools to any agent:
```bash
CAI>/mcp add burp redteam_agent
Adding tools from MCP server 'burp' to agent 'Red Team Agent'...

### Contributions

If you want to contribute to this project, use [**Pre-commit**](https://pre-commit.com/) before your MR

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit # files staged
pre-commit run --all-files # all files
```

### Optional Requirements: caiextensions

Currently, the extensions are not publicly available as the engineering endeavour to maintain them is significant. Instead, we're making selected custom caiextensions available for partner companies across collaborations.

### :information_source: Usage Data Collection

CAI is provided free of charge for researchers. To improve CAI’s detection accuracy and publish open security research, instead of payment for research use cases, we ask you to contribute to the CAI community by allowing usage data collection. This data helps us identify areas for improvement, understand how the framework is being used, and prioritize new features. Legal basis of data collection is under Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR — CAI’s legitimate interest in maintaining and improving security tooling, with Art. 89 safeguards for research. The collected data includes:

- Basic system information (OS type, Python version)
- Username and IP information
- Tool usage patterns and performance metrics
- Model interactions and token usage statistics

We take your privacy seriously and only collect what's needed to make CAI better. For further info, reach out to research＠aliasrobotics.com. You can disable some of the data collection features via the `CAI_TELEMETRY` environment variable but we encourage you to keep it enabled and contribute back to research:

```bash
CAI_TELEMETRY=False cai
```

### Reproduce CI-Setup locally

To simulate the CI/CD pipeline, you can run the following in the Gitlab runner machines:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --privileged \
  --network=exploitflow_net \
  --add-host="host.docker.internal:host-gateway" \
  -v /cache:/cache \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \
  registry.gitlab.com/aliasrobotics/alias_research/cai:latest bash
```



## FAQ
<details><summary>OLLAMA is giving me 404 errors</summary>

Ollama's API in OpenAI mode uses `/v1/chat/completions` whereas the `openai` library uses  `base_url` + `/chat/completions`.

We adopt the latter for overall alignment with the gen AI community and empower the former by allowing users to add the `v1` themselves via:

```bash
OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://IP:PORT/v1
```

<details><summary>If host networking is not working with ollama check whether it has been disabled in Docker because you are not signed in</summary>

Docker in OS X behaves funny sometimes. Check if the following message has shown up:

*Host networking has been disabled because you are not signed in. Please sign in to enable it*.

Make sure this has been addressed and also that the Dev Container is not forwarding the 8000 port (click on x, if necessary in the ports section).

To verify connection, from within the VSCode devcontainer:
```bash
curl -v http://host.docker.internal:8000/api/version

<summary>Run CAI against any target</summary>

![cai-004-first-message](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-004-first-message.png)

The starting user prompt in this case is: `Target IP: 192.168.3.10, perform a full network scan`.

The agent started performing a nmap scan. You could either interact with the agent and give it more instructions, or let it run to see what it explores next.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I interact with the agent? Type twice CTRL + C </summary>

![cai-005-ctrl-c](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-005-ctrl-c.png)

If you want to use the HITL mode, you can do it by presssing twice ```Ctrl + C```.
This will allow you to interact (prompt) with the agent whenever you want. The agent will not lose the previous context, as it is stored in the `history` variable, which is passed to it and any agent that is called. This enables any agent to use the previous information and be more accurate and efficient.
</details>

<details>
<summary> Can I change the model while CAI is running? /model </summary>

Use ```/model``` to change the model.

<details>
<summary>How can I list all the agents available? /agent </summary>

<details>
<summary>How can I trace the whole execution?</summary>
The environment variable `CAI_TRACING` allows the user to set it to `CAI_TRACING=true` to enable tracing, or `CAI_TRACING=false` to disable it.
When CAI is prompted by the first time, the user is provided with two paths, the execution log, and the tracing log.

![cai-009-logs](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-009-logs.png)

</details>


<details>
<summary>Can I expand CAI capabilities using previous run logs?</summary>

Yes. Today CAI performs best by relying on In‑Context Learning (ICL). Rather than building long‑term stores, the recommended workflow is to load relevant prior logs directly into the current session so the model can reason with them in context.

Use the `/load` command to bring JSONL logs into CAI’s context (this replaces the legacy memory-loading tool):

```bash
CAI>/load logs/cai_20250408_111856.jsonl         # Load into current agent
CAI>/load <file> agent <name>                    # Load into a specific agent
CAI>/load <file> all                             # Distribute across all agents
CAI>/load <file> parallel                        # Match to configured parallel agents
# Tip: if you omit <file>, /load uses `logs/last`. Alias: /l
```

CAI prints the path to the current run’s JSONL log at startup (highlighted in orange), which you can pass to `/load`:

![cai-009-logs](imgs/readme_imgs/cai-009-logs.png)

Legacy notes: earlier “memory extension” mechanisms (episodic/semantic stores and offline ingestion) are retained for reference only. See [src/cai/agents/memory.py](src/cai/agents/memory.py) for background and legacy details. Our current direction prioritizes ICL over persistent memory.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I expand CAI capabilities using scripts or extra information?</summary>

Currently, CAI supports text based information. You can add any extra information on the target you are facing by copy-pasting it directly into the system or user prompt.

**How?** By adding it to the system ([`system_master_template.md`](cai/repl/templates/system_master_template.md)) or the user prompt ([`user_master_template.md`](cai/repl/templates/user_master_template.md)). You can always directly prompt the path to the model, and it will ```cat``` it.
</details>


<details><summary>How CAI licence works?</summary>

CAI’s current license does not restrict usage for research purposes. You are free to use CAI for security assessments (pentests), to develop additional features, and to integrate it into your research activities, as long as you comply with local laws.

If you or your organization start benefiting commercially from CAI (e.g., offering pentesting services powered by CAI), then a commercial license will be required to help sustain the project.

CAI itself is not a profit-seeking initiative. Our goal is to build a sustainable open-source project. We simply ask that those who profit from CAI contribute back and support our ongoing development.

</details>

<details><summary>I get a `Unable to locate package python3.12-venv` when installing the prerequisites on my debian based system!</summary>

The easiest way to get around this is to simply install [`python3.12`](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) from source.
