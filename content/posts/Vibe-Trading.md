## 📰 News

- **2026-06-03** 🧹 **Community triage + trace correlation**: Tool-call trace entries now carry the originating `call_id`, so a `tool_result` can be matched back to its `tool_call` when replaying a run trace — arg previews stay truncated to keep trace files small ([#168](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/168), thanks @zwrong). Source comments no longer point at an internal-only docs path that external contributors couldn't find ([#166](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/166), thanks @jaleelpersonal). Also clarified that the `langchain-community` resolver warning on install is a harmless leftover-package notice, not a failure ([#167](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/167)), and scoped Gemini 2.5/3.0 `thoughtSignature` round-tripping for function calls as a `help wanted` task with a full fix plan ([#170](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/170), thanks @jliu6789).
- **2026-06-02** 🔌 **Six new broker connectors (Tiger / Longbridge / Alpaca / OKX / Binance / Futu)**: The connector-first trading layer gains a direct-SDK transport alongside IBKR (local) and Robinhood (MCP). Each connector exposes read-only account / positions / orders / quote / history **plus paper-account order placement** — test your strategies across these broker paper accounts. Five of them (Tiger, Alpaca, OKX, Binance, Futu) also support **bounded, mandate-gated order placement** behind the same safety model as Robinhood: a user-committed mandate (symbol universe / order size / exposure / leverage / daily cap), a filesystem kill switch, a fail-closed pre-trade gate, and a full audit ledger. **Longbridge is paper + read-only only** (its API exposes no runtime paper/live discriminator). Every paper/live distinction is a structural per-broker guard — account-id format, host separation, demo flag, or trade environment. New `trading_place_order` / `trading_cancel_order` tools; HK and A-share asset classes added to the mandate universe. Experimental / use at your own risk.
- **2026-06-01** 🚀 **v0.1.9 released** (`pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): Rolls up everything since 0.1.8. Connector-first broker profiles (IBKR local read-only TWS / IB Gateway + Robinhood Agentic Trading behind OAuth, a committed mandate, order guard, audit ledger, and instant halt). Research Goal runtime across CLI / REST / MCP / Web. A swarm pass — live reconcile + MCP keepalive, operator-configured worker MCP tools, a strict alpha-bench random control, and a new `retry_run` to relaunch failed/stale runs (**36 MCP tools** now). The `agent/cli/` package refactor with a refreshed terminal UI, the `mootdx` no-token A-share loader, and a robustness pass across backtest / agent loop / sessions. `--version` now always matches the installed package, fixing the 0.1.8 drift ([#156](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/156)).
<details>
<summary>Earlier news</summary>

- **2026-05-31** 🔌 **Connector-first broker architecture (IBKR + Robinhood)**: Trading access now starts from a selectable connector profile instead of separate broker/live entry points. `vibe-trading connector list/use/check/account/positions/orders/quote/history` and the MCP `trading_*` tools share the same selected profile, where paper/live is an attribute of the connector. IBKR can be used immediately through a local read-only TWS / IB Gateway profile, while the official IBKR remote MCP path is seeded as an OAuth `mcp.read` probe until stable read tool names are available. Robinhood Agentic Trading remains the bounded live MCP connector behind OAuth, a committed mandate, order guard, audit ledger, and instant halt.
- **2026-05-30** 🧰 **Robustness pass — backtest, agent loop, sessions**: LLM-generated signal engines now pass pre-flight interface validation before instantiation, catching circular self-imports, a missing `generate()`, non-defaulted `__init__` args, and wrong return types with actionable JSON errors instead of raw tracebacks ([#149](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/149)); a follow-up routes source-level AST validation errors through the same clean JSON envelope. The agent loop no longer burns all 50 iterations into a `failed` status with no output — it mirrors the swarm worker's wrap-up nudge at 80% of the iteration budget and drops tool definitions on the last iteration to force a final text answer ([#148](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/148)), guarded to fire only mid-run so it never displaces research-goal context. Session message writes now `flush + fsync` each append so expensive AI responses survive a mid-write crash, and the read path skips corrupted JSONL lines (logging the first 200 chars for recovery) instead of 500-ing the whole `/messages` endpoint ([#147](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/147)). The Web composer also fixes IME Enter handling so a composition-confirming Enter no longer submits mid-word ([#146](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/146)).
- **2026-05-29** 🔐 **Robinhood Agentic Trading support (opt-in, bounded autonomy)**: Adds support for Robinhood Agentic Trading (remote MCP, OAuth). Off and read-only by default; the agent acts only inside a user-committed mandate (symbols / order size / exposure / leverage / daily cap), with a filesystem-level instant kill switch, preemptive flatten, mandate auto-expiry, a full audit ledger, and a persistent autonomous runner. No custody, no venue — the broker holds funds and executes; we only relay intent. Experimental / use at your own risk.
- **2026-05-28** 🧪 **Swarm safety + strict alpha gate + worker MCP**: Swarm DAG blocks downstream tasks when upstream fails ([#145](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/145)). New `run_bench_strict()` adds a same-universe random control + OOS split to catch factors that just track market beta ([#143](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/143), thanks @Soli22de). Swarm workers can call operator-configured external MCP servers, with trust boundary pinned ([#142](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/142), thanks @shadowinlife).
- **2026-05-27** 📊 **mootdx A-share data source + output polish**: New `mootdx` loader speaks the native 通达信 TCP protocol for A-share OHLCV (no auth, no IP rate-limit, daily + intraday with 25-page walk-back pagination), slotting between tushare and akshare in the fallback chain ([#107](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/107)). CCXT loader now reads `HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/ALL_PROXY` so Binance/OKX public data works from restricted networks ([#126](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/126), thanks @ruok808). Final-answer rendering also dropped the ugly full-width `---` horizontal separators on CLI and Web: the system prompt now nudges the agent toward markdown tables and `##` headings, the CLI renderer strips standalone HRs as defense-in-depth, and the chat bubble hides any `<hr>` that slips through ([#139](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/139), thanks @sdwxm188).
- **2026-05-26** ✅ **Research Goal lifecycle closure**: Goal mode now behaves like a real task runner: Web UI goal creation creates or binds the session and immediately sends the kickoff turn; active goals can be continued, edited, cancelled, and completed across Web/API/CLI/MCP; and the agent advances from the current goal snapshot (criteria, evidence, claims, open items) instead of only the original prompt. Covered-but-still-active goals now enter an audit/status update instead of stopping silently, with regression coverage across backend, CLI, MCP, and frontend events.

- **2026-05-25** 🧼 **Cleaner chat UI + composer workflow**: The Web UI keeps chat focused on the next action: upload, swarm, and research-goal modes now live behind the composer `+` menu instead of floating panels. Active context appears above the input as compact chips, and goal details expand inline only when needed. The UI also drops the old custom i18n layer in favor of direct English copy, gates Full Report cards to report-worthy runs, and hardens local dev startup/status reporting for reliable browser smoke tests.
- **2026-05-24** 🎯 **Research Goal runtime**: Added a session-scoped Research Goal layer across backend, CLI, API/MCP, SSE, and Web UI. Goals persist claims, acceptance criteria, evidence rows, budgets, and completion policy; agent tools can create goals and attach evidence; `/goal` gives the CLI a direct entry point; REST/MCP expose goal snapshots and evidence writes; SSE keeps chat clients fresh. Follow-up audit fixes locked down verified evidence, blocked live-trading risk tiers through agent tools, wired CLI-created goals into later turns, cleaned goal ledgers on session deletion, enabled replay-all, and fixed cross-session frontend races.
- **2026-05-23** 🖥️ **Interactive CLI refresh**: The terminal front door now opens with a larger Vibe-Trading banner, a cleaner prompt divider, prior-turn recap, post-run timing, and a Claude Code-style activity rail for live agent work. Tool calls, web/data fetches, shell-style actions, Markdown answers, and pipe tables render in a more readable transcript, while piped or non-TTY runs keep plain-text output for automation. Generated CLI screenshots are now treated as local artifacts instead of committed docs files, keeping the repository lighter.
- **2026-05-22** 🧭 **Swarm recovery + MCP keepalive**: Swarm status now reconciles from live task files on every read, so API/MCP/SSE/list views recover crashed or stale runs instead of showing permanent `running` snapshots. `run_swarm` sends MCP progress heartbeats while it polls, with a fixed first frame of `swarm_started run_id=<id>` for clients that reconnect after transport drops; workers now heartbeat through LLM streaming, grounding fetches, and tool execution. The stale-run reaper uses per-run thresholds and derives terminal status from task states, `SwarmTool` no longer cancels a still-running team just because its wait budget elapsed, and MCP clients can call `reap_stale_runs()` for explicit cleanup. Today's DX pass also refreshed provider default models and aligned CI syntax checks with the new `agent/cli/` package. 22 new regressions cover hydration, terminal recovery, stale reaping, keepalive cadence, env parsing, and heartbeat wiring; the full swarm/MCP suite is at 169 passed, 4 skipped.
- **2026-05-21** 🧱 **CLI package refactor**: `agent/cli.py` (3216 LOC) split into the `agent/cli/` package — interactive front door, slash router, Rich components, plus a `_legacy.py` shim that preserves every subcommand and re-exports every public symbol so `cli.cmd_*` / `cli._INIT_ENV_PATH` / `cli.Confirm` keep working. New FastAPI middleware serves the SPA shell when a browser opens `/runs/{id}` or `/correlation` directly; same narrowing landed in the Vite dev proxy. Version unified via `cli/_version.py` (no more drift between `--version` and the banner), `python -m cli` restored via `__main__.py`, and the chat-gate narrowed so `chat --help` / `chat extra` reach legacy argparse instead of being swallowed by the REPL.
- **2026-05-20** 🔬 **Hypothesis Registry CLI**: Closes the CLI side of the Hypothesis Registry shipped backend-only on 2026-05-16. `vibe-trading hypothesis list` prints a Rich table or JSON (`--status` filter, `--limit`); `show <id>` renders a detail panel including linked run cards; `invalidate <id> --note "..."` flips status to `rejected` while preserving prior invalidation notes when `--note` is omitted. Honors the existing `VIBE_TRADING_HYPOTHESES_PATH` env override and adds a per-invocation `--path`. 22 new tests cover wiring, JSON output, status filter, limit, missing-id errors, and note persistence.
- **2026-05-19** ✨ **Live tool feedback + graceful cancel**: Long-running tools (backtests, large PDFs, swarm workers) no longer look frozen. Each tool call now emits a 3-second heartbeat plus structured per-stage progress — `run_backtest` shows phase markers (`validate` / `simulate` / `finalize`), `read_document` ticks per page on PDF or per sheet on Excel, `read_url` marks `fetch` / `parse`. The CLI Rich Live dashboard renders a Unicode spinner, ASCII progress bar, ETA, and stacks up to 3 parallel tools keyed by name; the frontend chat ships a new `ToolProgressIndicator` with rAF-coalesced renders, ARIA `role="status"` + hidden native `<progress>` for screen readers, and a determinate `ProgressRing` SVG when total is known. First `Ctrl+C` during a CLI run now calls `agent.cancel()` for graceful exit (current step finishes, trace closes cleanly); a second within 2s force-quits. Reusable primitives extracted along the way: `ProgressBar.tsx` and `lib/tools.ts` (shared tool-name i18n).
- **2026-05-18** 🧹 **Cleanup pass + three latent bug fixes**: `CompositeEngine` no longer misroutes bare Chinese-futures codes like `RB2410` to `GlobalFuturesEngine` — `_is_china_futures` moved into a shared `_market_hooks` module with a case-normalized product table and a non-CN exchange guard, plus 9 new regression cases. Session FTS5 indexes now persist timestamps so cross-session search can sort by date; the same path also fixed a re-upsert that was wall-clocking every session's `started_at`. The Vite dev-mode proxy gained the missing `/alpha` entry so the AlphaZoo page resolves on `npm run dev`. `tests/test_e2e_harness_v2.py` (real-LLM e2e suite) is now gated behind `VIBE_TRADING_RUN_LIVE_E2E=1` so CI no longer changes shape based on env-key presence. Ruff `per-file-ignores` added for the factor zoo (3783 → 0 F401 noise), frontend tsconfig enables `noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters` as regression guards, and 76 unused `vw = vwap(...)` boilerplate lines were dropped from `gtja191` alphas. Net **-918 LOC**.
- **2026-05-17** 🧬 **Alpha Zoo v1 (0.1.8)**: 452 pre-built quant alphas across 4 zoos — `qlib158` (Microsoft Qlib, Apache-2 attribution), `alpha101` (Kakushadze 101 Formulaic Alphas, paper rewrite from arXiv:1601.00991), `gtja191` (Guotai Junan 2014 short-horizon factor report), and `academic` (Fama-French 5 + Carhart price-based proxies). One-line CLI to bench any zoo on your universe: `vibe-trading alpha bench --zoo gtja191 --universe csi300 --period 2018-2025`. Ships with AST purity gate, lookahead-guard test, `pytest-socket` network kill-switch, per-zoo LICENSE.md, and a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) workflow for community PRs. Auto-rendered Alpha Library at [vibetrading.wiki/alpha-library/](https://vibetrading.wiki/alpha-library/) + research-lab post [Which of the 191 GTJA alphas still work in 2026?](https://vibetrading.wiki/research-lab/posts/alpha-191-in-2026.html).
- **2026-05-16** 🧪 **Research spine update**: Added a backend Hypothesis Registry with `create_hypothesis`, `update_hypothesis`, `link_backtest`, and `search_hypotheses`; external-content readers now attach warning-only `security_warnings`; and Shadow Account scanning now uses deterministic OHLCV feature evaluation instead of the old calendar-phase stub.
- **2026-05-15** 🪪 The run detail page now surfaces the Trust Layer run card alongside metrics and artifacts, completing the UI side of the `run_card.json` work landed on 2026-05-12. `PersistentMemory.add()` was also hardened on length, empty/whitespace-only names, and C0/C1 control bytes from the #108/#109/#110 triage ([#112](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/112), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak).
- **2026-05-14** 🌐 the public wiki is now live at [vibetrading.wiki](https://vibetrading.wiki/) with docs, tutorials, Research Lab, and Alpha Library sections deployed through Cloudflare Pages. Persistent memory is also inspectable from the CLI via `vibe-trading memory list/show/search/forget` ([#102](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/102), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak), and memory tokenization/slugs now support Thai, Arabic, Hebrew, and Cyrillic text ([#104](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/104)).
- **2026-05-13** 🧭 Swarm runs now ground workers with fetched market data and cleaner persisted reports ([#93](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/93), [#84](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/84)).
- **2026-05-12** 🧾 Backtests now emit `run_card.json` and `run_card.md` alongside artifacts for reproducible research runs.
- **2026-05-11** 🧭 **Memory slugs, swarm accounting, and CLI preflight**: Persistent memory now preserves CJK characters when generating file slugs, preventing silent filename collisions for Chinese/Japanese/Korean notes ([#95](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/95), thanks @voidborne-d). Swarm run totals now prefer provider-reported token usage with the existing estimate fallback ([#94](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/94), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak), and the CLI run UI gained a startup preflight check for common environment issues ([#96](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/96), thanks @ykykj).
- **2026-05-10** 🧱 **Regression guardrails + run metadata**: Memory recall now treats underscores as token boundaries, so snake_case saved memories such as `mcp_wiring_test` match natural-language queries like "mcp wiring" ([#87](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/87), thanks @hp083625). The MCP server has a subprocess smoke test covering initialize → `tools/list` → `tools/call` to guard the first-call deadlock path ([#86](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/86)), while low-risk hardening landed for Windows path-sensitive tests, API best-effort exception handling, backtest `run_dir` allowed-root validation, and SwarmRun provider/model metadata ([#88](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/88), [#90](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/90), [#91](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/91), [#92](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/92), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak).
- **2026-05-09** 🛡️ **API path hardening + MCP server stability**: API run/session routes now validate path IDs before lookup, rejecting malformed newline-containing parameters and pinning the behavior in the auth/security regression suite ([#80](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/80), thanks @SJoon99). The MCP server now pre-warms the tool registry on the main thread before serving `tools/call`, avoiding a first-call deadlock in lazy tool discovery ([#85](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/85), thanks @Teerapat-Vatpitak). The Vite dev proxy also honors `VITE_API_URL` for non-default backend targets ([#82](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/82), thanks @voidborne-d).
- **2026-05-08** 🧾 **Tushare statement fields in filters**: A-share daily backtests can now request PIT-safe financial statement fields through `fundamental_fields`, so signal engines can screen on `income_total_revenue`, `income_n_income`, `balancesheet_total_hldr_eqy_exc_min_int`, `fina_indicator_roe`, and similar table-prefixed columns after their announcement/disclosure dates ([#76](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/76), thanks @mrbob-git). Follow-up hardening makes explicit statement-field requests fail fast if Tushare enrichment cannot run, instead of silently falling back to raw price bars ([#77](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/77)).
- **2026-05-07** 📈 **Tushare fundamentals + community triage**: Added a point-in-time `TushareFundamentalProvider` contract for fundamental research workflows, with regression coverage for the project `TUSHARE_TOKEN` environment path ([#74](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/74)). Community triage also clarified that Vibe-Trading keeps rapid iteration focused on one UI language for now, avoids adding redundant search dependencies while DuckDuckGo-backed `web_search` is already bundled, and treats unofficial hosted deployments as untrusted places for API keys or data-source tokens.
- **2026-05-06** 🚀 **v0.1.7 released** ([Release notes](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/releases/tag/v0.1.7), `pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): Security-boundary hardening is now published on PyPI and ClawHub, covering safer API/read/upload/file/URL/generated-code/shell-tool/Docker defaults while keeping localhost CLI/Web UI workflows low-friction. This cycle also includes Web UI Settings, correlation heatmap, OpenAI Codex OAuth, A-share pre-ST filtering, interactive CLI UX, swarm preset inspection, dividend analysis, dev workflow polish, and audited frontend build-dependency floors. Thanks to the 0.1.7 contributors and to lemi9090 (S2W) for coordinated security validation.
- **2026-05-05** 🛡️ **Security boundary follow-up**: Completes the remaining security-boundary hardening around explicit CORS origins, Settings credential indicators, web URL reading, and Shadow Account code generation, with regression tests added for each path. Normal localhost CLI/Web UI workflows stay the same; remote deployments should continue using `API_AUTH_KEY` and explicit trusted origins.
- **2026-05-04** 🖥️ **Interactive CLI UX + CI cleanup**: Interactive mode now has a live bottom status bar showing provider/model, session duration, last-run latency, and cumulative tool-call stats, plus prompt history navigation and cursor editing with arrow keys via `prompt_toolkit` ([#69](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/69)). The CLI still falls back to Rich prompts when `prompt_toolkit` or a TTY is unavailable. CI path expectations were also aligned with the hardened file-import sandbox and cross-platform `/tmp` resolution, returning main to green ([`bb67dc7`](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/commit/bb67dc7cfcc11553c57d8962bee56381dca43758)).
- **2026-05-03** 🛡️ **Security hardening patch**: Tightens default API authentication for non-local deployments, protects sensitive run/session/swarm reads, restricts upload and local file-reading boundaries, gates shell-capable tools by entry point, validates generated strategy loading before import, and runs the Docker image as a non-root user with a localhost-only published port by default. Local CLI and localhost Web UI workflows remain low-friction; remote API/Web deployments should set `API_AUTH_KEY`.
- **2026-05-02** 🧭 **Dividend analysis + sharper roadmap**: Added the `dividend-analysis` skill for income stocks, payout sustainability, dividend growth, shareholder yield, ex-dividend mechanics, and yield-trap checks, pinned by bundled-skill regression tests. The public roadmap now focuses on upcoming work: Research Autopilot, Data Bridge, Options Lab, Portfolio Studio, Alpha Zoo, Research Delivery, Trust Layer, and Community sharing.
- **2026-05-01** 🔥 **Correlation heatmap + OpenAI Codex OAuth + A-share pre-ST filter**: New correlation dashboard/API computes rolling return correlations and renders an ECharts heatmap for portfolio and symbol analysis ([#64](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/64)). OpenAI Codex provider support now uses ChatGPT OAuth via `vibe-trading provider login openai-codex`, with Settings metadata and adapter regression tests ([#65](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/65)). Added and hardened the `ashare-pre-st-filter` skill for A-share ST/*ST risk screening, including Sina penalty relevance filtering so securities-account mentions do not inflate E2 counts ([#63](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/63)).
- **2026-04-30** ⚙️ **Web UI Settings + validation CLI hardening**: New Settings page for LLM provider/model, base URL, reasoning effort, and data source credentials, backed by local/auth-protected settings APIs and data-driven provider metadata ([#57](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/57)). Also hardens `python -m backtest.validation <run_dir>` so missing, blank, malformed, non-existent, and non-directory inputs fail with clear operator-facing messages before validation starts ([#60](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/60)).
- **2026-04-28** 🚀 **v0.1.6 released** (`pip install -U vibe-trading-ai`): Fixes `vibe-trading --swarm-presets` returning empty after `pip install` / `uv tool install` ([#55](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/55)) — preset YAMLs now bundled inside the `src.swarm` package and pinned by a 6-test regression suite. Plus AKShare loader correctly routes ETFs (`510300.SH`) and forex (`USDCNH`) to the right endpoints with hardened registry fallback. Rolls up everything since v0.1.5: benchmark comparison panel, `/upload` streaming + size limits, Futu loader (HK + A-share), vnpy export skill, security hardening, frontend lazy loading (688KB → 262KB).
- **2026-04-27** 📊 **Benchmark panel + upload safety**: Backtest output now ships a benchmark comparison panel (ticker / benchmark return / excess return / information ratio) with yfinance-backed resolution for SPY, CSI 300, etc. ([#48](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/48)). Plus `/upload` streams the request body in 1 MB chunks and aborts past `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`, bounding memory under oversized/malformed clients ([#53](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/53)) — pinned by a 4-case regression suite.
- **2026-04-22** 🛡️ **Hardening + new integrations**: Path containment enforced in `safe_path` + journal/shadow tool sandbox, `MANIFEST.in` ships `.env.example` / tests / Docker files in sdist, route-level lazy loading shrinks frontend initial bundle 688KB → 262KB. Plus Futu data loader for HK & A-share equities ([#47](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/47)) and vnpy CtaTemplate export skill ([#46](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/46)).

- **2026-04-20** 🔌 **Reasoning + Swarm**: `reasoning_content` preserved across all `ChatOpenAI` paths — Kimi / DeepSeek / Qwen thinking work end-to-end ([#39](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/39)). Swarm streaming + clean Ctrl+C ([#42](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/42)).
- **2026-04-19** 📦 **v0.1.5**: Published to PyPI & ClawHub. `python-multipart` CVE floor bump, 5 new MCP tools wired (`analyze_trade_journal` + 4 shadow-account tools), `pattern_recognition` → `pattern` registry fix, Docker dep parity, SKILL manifest synced (22 MCP tools / 71 skills).
- **2026-04-18** 👥 **Shadow Account**: Extract your strategy rules from a broker journal → backtest the shadow across markets → 8-section HTML/PDF report showing exactly how much you leave on the table (rule violations, early exits, missed signals, counterfactual trades). 4 new tools, 1 skill, 32 tools total. Trade Journal + Shadow Account samples now live in the web UI welcome screen.
- **2026-04-17** 📊 **Trade Journal Analyzer + Universal File Reader**: Upload broker exports (同花顺/东财/富途/generic CSV) → auto trading profile (holding days, win rate, PnL ratio, drawdown) + 4 bias diagnostics (disposition effect, overtrading, chasing momentum, anchoring). `read_document` now dispatches PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, images (OCR), and 40+ text formats behind one unified call.
- **2026-04-16** 🧠 **Agent Harness**: Persistent cross-session memory, FTS5 session search, self-evolving skills (full CRUD), 5-layer context compression, read/write tool batching. 27 tools, 107 new tests.
- **2026-04-15** 🤖 **Z.ai + MiniMax**: Z.ai provider ([#35](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/35)), MiniMax temperature fix + model update ([#33](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/33)). 13 providers.
- **2026-04-14** 🔧 **MCP Stability**: Fixed backtest tool `Connection closed` error on stdio transport ([#32](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/32)).
- **2026-04-13** 🌐 **Cross-Market Composite Backtest**: New `CompositeEngine` backtests mixed-market portfolios (e.g. A-shares + crypto) with shared capital pool and per-market rules. Also fixed swarm template variable fallback and frontend timeout.
- **2026-04-12** 🌍 **Multi-Platform Export**: `/pine` exports strategies to TradingView (Pine Script v6), TDX (通达信/同花顺/东方财富), and MetaTrader 5 (MQL5) in one command.
- **2026-04-11** 🛡️ **Reliability & DX**: `vibe-trading init` .env bootstrap ([#19](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/19)), preflight checks, runtime data-source fallback, hardened backtest engine. Multi-language README ([#21](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/pull/21)).
- **2026-04-10** 📦 **v0.1.4**: Docker fix ([#8](https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading/issues/8)), `web_search` MCP tool, 12 LLM providers, `akshare`/`ccxt` deps. Published to PyPI and ClawHub.

## 💡 What Is Vibe-Trading?

Vibe-Trading is an open-source research workspace for turning finance questions into runnable analysis. It connects natural-language prompts to market-data loaders, strategy generation, backtest engines, reports, exports, and persistent research memory.

It is designed for research, simulation, and backtesting — and, when you choose, autonomous trading through a broker you authorize yourself (e.g. Robinhood Agentic Trading). It holds no funds and never trades outside the limits you set, and you can halt it instantly.

---

## ✨ What You Can Do

| Task | Output |
|------|--------|
| **Ask a trading question** | Market research with tools, data, documents, and reusable session context. |
| **Backtest a strategy idea** | Strategy code, metrics, benchmark context, validation artifacts, and run cards. |
| **Review your own trades** | Broker-journal parsing, behavior diagnostics, rule extraction, and Shadow Account comparisons. |
| **Improve repeated research** | Persistent memory and editable skills turn useful routines into reusable workflows. |
| **Run analyst teams** | Multi-agent research reviews for investment, quant, crypto, macro, and risk workflows. |
| **Ship usable artifacts** | Reports, TradingView Pine Script, TDX, MetaTrader 5, MCP tools, and later research sessions. |
| **Bench a pre-built alpha zoo** | One-line IC + alive/reversed/dead categorisation across 452 alphas (Qlib 158 + Kakushadze 101 + GTJA 191 + FF5 + Carhart) on your universe. |

---

## ⚡ Quick Example

```bash
pip install vibe-trading-ai

# Natural-language research
vibe-trading run -p "Backtest a BTC-USDT 20/50 moving-average strategy for 2024, summarize return and drawdown, then export the report"

# Bench a pre-built alpha zoo (one line)
vibe-trading alpha bench --zoo gtja191 --universe csi300 --period 2018-2025 --top 20
```

```bash
vibe-trading --upload trades_export.csv
vibe-trading run -p "Analyze my trading behavior, extract my shadow strategy, and compare it with my actual trades"
```

---

## 👥 Shadow Account

Shadow Account starts from your own trading records instead of a generic strategy template.

Upload a broker export, let the agent summarize your behavior, then compare the actual trading path with a rule-based shadow strategy.

| Step | Agent output |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Read your journal** | Parses broker exports from 同花顺, 东方财富, 富途, and generic CSV formats. |
| **2. Profile your behavior** | Holding days, win rate, PnL ratio, drawdown, disposition effect, overtrading, momentum chasing, and anchoring checks. |
| **3. Extract your rules** | Turns recurring entries/exits into an explicit strategy profile instead of a hand-wavy summary. |
| **4. Run the shadow** | Backtests the extracted rules and highlights rule breaks, early exits, missed signals, and alternative trade paths. |
| **5. Deliver the report** | Produces an HTML/PDF report that can be inspected, archived, or refined in a later session. |

```bash
vibe-trading --upload trades_export.csv
vibe-trading run -p "Analyze my trading behavior, extract my shadow strategy, and compare it with my actual trades"
```

---

## 🧪 Research Workflow

Most runs follow the same evidence path: route the request, load the right market context, execute tools, validate outputs, and keep the artifacts inspectable.

| Layer | What happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Plan** | Selects the relevant finance skills, tools, data sources, and swarm preset when useful. |
| **Ground** | Pulls A-shares, HK/US equities, crypto, futures, forex, documents, or web context through the available loaders. |
| **Execute** | Generates testable strategy code, runs tools, and uses the matching backtest engine or analysis workflow. |
| **Validate** | Adds metrics, benchmark comparison, Monte Carlo, Bootstrap, Walk-Forward, run cards, and warnings where applicable. |
| **Deliver** | Returns reports, artifacts, tool traces, and exports for TradingView, TDX, MetaTrader 5, MCP clients, or later sessions. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-line install (PyPI)

```bash
pip install vibe-trading-ai
```

Then run a first research task:

```bash
vibe-trading init
vibe-trading run -p "Backtest a BTC-USDT 20/50 moving-average strategy for 2024 and summarize return and drawdown"
```

> **Package name vs commands:** The PyPI package is `vibe-trading-ai`. Once installed, you get three commands:
>
> | Command | Purpose |
> |---------|---------|
> | `vibe-trading` | Interactive CLI / TUI |
> | `vibe-trading serve` | Launch FastAPI web server |
> | `vibe-trading-mcp` | Start MCP server (for Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, Cursor, etc.) |

```bash
vibe-trading init              # interactive .env setup
vibe-trading                   # launch CLI
vibe-trading serve --port 8899 # launch web UI
vibe-trading-mcp               # start MCP server (stdio)
```

### Or choose a path

| Path | Best for | Time |
|------|----------|------|
| **A. Docker** | Try it now, zero local setup | 2 min |
| **B. Local install** | Development, full CLI access | 5 min |
| **C. MCP plugin** | Plug into your existing agent | 3 min |
| **D. ClawHub** | One command, no cloning | 1 min |

### Prerequisites

- An **LLM API key** from any supported provider — or run locally with **Ollama** (no key needed)
- **Python 3.11+** for Path B
- **Docker** for Path A
- OpenAI Codex can also be used with ChatGPT OAuth: set `LANGCHAIN_PROVIDER=openai-codex`, then run `vibe-trading provider login openai-codex`. This does not use `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

> **Supported LLM providers:** OpenRouter, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Groq, DashScope/Qwen, Zhipu, Moonshot/Kimi, MiniMax, Xiaomi MIMO, Z.ai, Ollama (local). See `.env.example` for config.

> **Tip:** All markets work without any API keys thanks to automatic fallback. yfinance (HK/US), OKX (crypto), mootdx (A-shares, TCP-direct, no IP throttle), and AKShare (A-shares, US, HK, futures, forex) are all free. Tushare token is optional — mootdx is the preferred no-token A-share fallback, with AKShare as a broader backup.

### Path A: Docker (zero setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading.git
cd Vibe-Trading
cp agent/.env.example agent/.env
# Edit agent/.env — uncomment your LLM provider and set API key
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8899`. Backend + frontend in one container.

Docker publishes the backend on `127.0.0.1:8899` by default and runs the app as a non-root container user. If you intentionally expose the API beyond your own machine, set a strong `API_AUTH_KEY` and send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` from clients.

### Path B: Local install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/Vibe-Trading.git
cd Vibe-Trading
python -m venv .venv

# Activate
source .venv/bin/activate          # Linux / macOS
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1       # Windows PowerShell

pip install -e .
cp agent/.env.example agent/.env   # Edit — set your LLM provider API key
vibe-trading                       # Launch interactive TUI
```

<details>
<summary><b>Start web UI (optional)</b></summary>

```bash
# Terminal 1: API server
vibe-trading serve --port 8899

# Terminal 2: Frontend dev server
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5899`. The frontend proxies API calls to `localhost:8899`.

**Production mode (single server):**

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..
vibe-trading serve --port 8899     # FastAPI serves dist/ as static files
```

</details>

### Path C: MCP plugin

See [MCP Plugin](#-mcp-plugin) section below.

### Path D: ClawHub (one command)

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install vibe-trading --force
```

The skill + MCP config is downloaded into your agent's skills directory. See [ClawHub install](#-mcp-plugin) for details.

---

## 🧠 Environment Variables

Copy `agent/.env.example` to `agent/.env` and uncomment the provider block you want. Each provider needs 3-4 variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|:--------:|-------------|
| `LANGCHAIN_PROVIDER` | Yes | Provider name (`openrouter`, `deepseek`, `groq`, `ollama`, etc.) |
| `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` | Yes* | API key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, etc.) |
| `<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL` | Yes | API endpoint URL |
| `LANGCHAIN_MODEL_NAME` | Yes | Model name (e.g. `deepseek-v4-pro`) |
| `TUSHARE_TOKEN` | No | Tushare Pro token for A-share data (falls back to AKShare) |
| `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | No | LLM call timeout, default 120s |
| `API_AUTH_KEY` | Recommended for network deployments | Bearer token required when the API is reachable from non-local clients |
| `VIBE_TRADING_ENABLE_SHELL_TOOLS` | No | Explicit opt-in for shell-capable tools in remote API/MCP-SSE style deployments |
| `VIBE_TRADING_ALLOWED_FILE_ROOTS` | No | Extra comma-separated roots for document and broker-journal imports |
| `VIBE_TRADING_ALLOWED_RUN_ROOTS` | No | Extra comma-separated roots for generated-code run directories |

<sub>* Ollama does not require an API key. OpenAI Codex uses ChatGPT OAuth and stores tokens via `oauth-cli-kit`, not in `agent/.env`.</sub>

**Free data (no key needed):** A-shares via AKShare, HK/US equities via yfinance, crypto via OKX, 100+ crypto exchanges via CCXT. The system automatically selects the best available source for each market.

### 🎯 Recommended Models

Vibe-Trading is a tool-heavy agent — skills, backtests, memory, and swarms all flow through tool calls. Model choice directly decides whether the agent *uses* its tools or fabricates answers from training data.

| Tier | Examples | When to use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Best** | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, `openai/gpt-5.5-pro`, `google/gemini-3.5-flash` | Complex swarms (3+ agents), long research sessions, paper-grade analysis |
| **Sweet spot** (default) | `deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, `x-ai/grok-4.20`, `z-ai/glm-5.1`, `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`, `qwen/qwen3-max-thinking` | Daily driver — reliable tool-calling at ~1/10 the cost |
| **Avoid for agent use** | `*-nano`, `*-flash-lite`, `*-coder-next`, small / distilled variants | Tool-calling is unreliable — the agent will appear to "answer from memory" instead of loading skills or running backtests |

The default `agent/.env.example` ships with DeepSeek official API + `deepseek-v4-pro`; OpenRouter users can use `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`.

---

## 🖥 CLI Reference

The interactive TUI (`vibe-trading`) now uses a terminal-native transcript: a startup banner, prompt rule, previous-turn recap, live activity rail, Markdown/table rendering, and run timing all stay in the CLI. Non-interactive invocations such as `vibe-trading run`, pipes, and `--json` remain script-friendly.

```bash
vibe-trading               # interactive TUI
vibe-trading run -p "..."  # single run
vibe-trading serve         # API server
vibe-trading alpha list    # browse 452 pre-built alphas; show / bench / compare / export-manifest sub-commands available

## 💡 Examples

### Strategy & Backtesting

```bash
# Moving average crossover on US equities
vibe-trading run -p "Backtest a 20/50-day moving average crossover on AAPL for the past year, show Sharpe ratio and max drawdown"

# RSI mean-reversion on crypto
vibe-trading run -p "Test RSI(14) mean-reversion on BTC-USDT: buy below 30, sell above 70, last 6 months"

# Multi-factor strategy on A-shares

vibe-trading alpha show gtja191_171
```

**Compose a multi-factor signal** from the zoo (Python):
```python
from src.skills.multi_factor.zoo_signal_engine import ZooSignalEngine
engine = ZooSignalEngine.from_zoo(["gtja191_171", "gtja191_111", "gtja191_163"])
panel = ...  # your wide OHLCV panel
signal = engine.compute_signal(panel)
```

### Market Research

```bash
# Equity deep-dive
vibe-trading run -p "Research NVDA: earnings trend, analyst consensus, option flow, and key risks for next quarter"

# Macro analysis
vibe-trading run -p "Analyze the current Fed rate path, USD strength, and impact on EM equities and gold"

### Security defaults

For localhost development, `vibe-trading serve` keeps the browser workflow simple. For any non-local client, sensitive API endpoints require `API_AUTH_KEY`; use `Authorization: Bearer <key>` for JSON/upload requests. Browser EventSource streams are handled by the Web UI after you enter the same key once in Settings.

Shell-capable tools are available to local CLI and trusted localhost workflows, but are not exposed to remote API sessions unless you explicitly set `VIBE_TRADING_ENABLE_SHELL_TOOLS=1`. Document and journal readers are limited to upload/import roots by default; place files under `agent/uploads`, `agent/runs`, `./uploads`, `./data`, `~/.vibe-trading/uploads`, or `~/.vibe-trading/imports`, or add a dedicated directory through `VIBE_TRADING_ALLOWED_FILE_ROOTS`.

### Web UI Settings

The Web UI Settings page lets local users update the LLM provider/model, base URL, generation parameters, reasoning effort, and optional market data credentials such as the Tushare token. Settings are persisted to `agent/.env`; provider defaults are loaded from `agent/src/providers/llm_providers.json`.

Settings reads are side-effect free: `GET /settings/llm` and `GET /settings/data-sources` never create `agent/.env`, and they only return project-relative paths. Settings reads and writes can expose credential state or update credentials/runtime environment, so they require `API_AUTH_KEY` when configured. If `API_AUTH_KEY` is unset for dev mode, settings access is accepted only from loopback clients.

## 🔌 MCP Plugin

Vibe-Trading exposes 36 MCP tools for any MCP-compatible client. Runs as a stdio subprocess — no server setup needed. Core research tools work with zero API keys for HK/US/crypto; trading connector tools use the selected connector profile, and `run_swarm` needs an LLM key.

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-trading": {
      "command": "vibe-trading-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenClaw</b></summary>

Add to `~/.openclaw/config.yaml`:

```yaml
skills:
  - name: vibe-trading
    command: vibe-trading-mcp
```

For a first research-only smoke test, confirm tool discovery and run a market
data or backtest request before selecting a trading connector profile. Core
research tools can run without broker credentials; connector-backed `trading_*`
tools should be used only after you intentionally select and check a connector
profile. `run_swarm` requires an LLM key.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor / Windsurf / other MCP clients</b></summary>

```bash
vibe-trading-mcp                  # stdio (default)
vibe-trading-mcp --transport sse  # SSE for web clients
```

</details>

**MCP tools exposed (36):** `list_skills`, `load_skill`, `start_research_goal`, `get_research_goal`, `add_goal_evidence`, `update_research_goal_status`, `backtest`, `factor_analysis`, `analyze_options`, `pattern_recognition`, `read_url`, `read_document`, `web_search`, `write_file`, `read_file`, `list_swarm_presets`, `run_swarm`, `get_market_data`, `get_swarm_status`, `get_run_result`, `list_runs`, `reap_stale_runs`, `retry_run`, `analyze_trade_journal`, `extract_shadow_strategy`, `run_shadow_backtest`, `render_shadow_report`, `scan_shadow_signals`, `trading_connections`, `trading_select_connection`, `trading_check`, `trading_account`, `trading_positions`, `trading_orders`, `trading_quote`, `trading_history`.

### SWARM external MCP tools

`run_swarm` workers can call operator-approved tools from external MCP servers. Configure the server-side allowlist in `VIBE_TRADING_SWARM_AGENT_CONFIG`, `~/.vibe-trading/swarm-agent.json`, or the fallback `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json`; then list remote tools in a swarm preset using the local MCP wrapper name, such as `mcp_internal_kb_search`. Caller-provided `variables` stay template data only and cannot inject MCP URLs, commands, environment variables, or allowlist overrides.

<details>
<summary><b>Install from ClawHub (one command)</b></summary>

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install vibe-trading --force
```

> `--force` is required because the skill references external APIs, which triggers VirusTotal's automated scan. The code is fully open-source and safe to inspect.

This downloads the skill + MCP config into your agent's skills directory. No cloning needed.

Browse on ClawHub: [clawhub.ai/skills/vibe-trading](https://clawhub.ai/skills/vibe-trading)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenSpace — self-evolving skills</b></summary>

All 77 finance skills are published on [open-space.cloud](https://open-space.cloud) and evolve autonomously through OpenSpace's self-evolution engine.

To use with OpenSpace, add both MCP servers to your agent config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openspace": {
      "command": "openspace-mcp",
      "toolTimeout": 600,
      "env": {
        "OPENSPACE_HOST_SKILL_DIRS": "/path/to/vibe-trading/agent/src/skills",
        "OPENSPACE_WORKSPACE": "/path/to/OpenSpace"
      }
    },
    "vibe-trading": {
      "command": "vibe-trading-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

OpenSpace will auto-discover all 77 skills, enabling auto-fix, auto-improve, and community sharing. Search for Vibe-Trading skills via `search_skills("finance backtest")` in any OpenSpace-connected agent.

## 🔌 Loading Tools from External MCP Servers (MCP Client Mode)

> **This is the opposite direction from the MCP Plugin above.**
> The MCP Plugin lets *other* agents call Vibe-Trading tools.
> This section lets the *built-in* Vibe-Trading agent call tools from *your* external MCP servers.

### Quick start

Create `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["my-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Run any CLI command — tools from ordinary external servers are automatically injected into the agent's registry after local tools:

```bash
vibe-trading run "use my-server to do X"
```

### Official IBKR MCP read-only probe

Vibe-Trading can connect directly to Interactive Brokers' official remote MCP
endpoint in read-only mode. Add this to `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ibkr": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "https://api.ibkr.com/v1/api/mcp",
      "auth": {
        "type": "oauth",
        "scopes": ["mcp.read"],
        "clientName": "Vibe-Trading",
        "cacheDir": "~/.vibe-trading/live/ibkr/oauth"
      },
      "enabledTools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then start the browser OAuth flow:

```bash
vibe-trading connector authorize ibkr-live-official-mcp-readonly
```

The wildcard is accepted only for IBKR's `mcp.read` probe. Authorizing this
profile confirms access to IBKR's official read scope; generic `trading_account`
and `trading_positions` calls stay disabled until IBKR publishes stable read
tool names that Vibe-Trading can map safely. A config that adds `mcp.write` must
pin an explicit tool allowlist and still passes through the live order guard.

If IBKR issues a pre-registered OAuth client, add `clientId` and `clientSecret`
inside `auth`.

### Trading connectors: fastest path

For users who cannot wait for IBKR OAuth client approval, connect to a local
TWS or IB Gateway session. Credentials stay inside IBKR's desktop app; Vibe-
Trading only connects to `127.0.0.1` and exposes it as a connector profile.

Install the optional SDK:

```bash
pip install "vibe-trading-ai[ibkr]"
```

Open TWS paper trading or IB Gateway paper, enable API socket clients, then run:

```bash
vibe-trading connector list
vibe-trading connector use ibkr-paper-local
vibe-trading connector configure ibkr-paper-local --yes
vibe-trading connector check
vibe-trading connector account
vibe-trading connector positions
vibe-trading connector orders
vibe-trading connector quote AAPL
vibe-trading connector history AAPL --duration "30 D" --bar-size "1 day"
```

Default local ports:

| App | Paper | Live read-only |
|-----|-------|----------------|
| TWS | `7497` | `7496` |
| IB Gateway | `4002` | `4001` |

The agent exposes connector-scoped tools named `trading_connections`,
`trading_select_connection`, `trading_check`, `trading_account`,
`trading_positions`, `trading_orders`, `trading_quote`, and `trading_history`.
Live-broker raw MCP tools are not registered directly as `mcp_<broker>_*`.
No IBKR order-placement tool is registered.

### Config reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | inferred for stdio; required for HTTP | Omit for stdio, or set to `sse` / `streamableHttp` for URL-based servers. |
| `command` | string | required for stdio | Executable to spawn for stdio servers. Invalid for `sse` / `streamableHttp` servers. |
| `args` | array | `[]` | Command-line arguments for stdio servers only. |
| `env` | object | `{}` | Extra environment variables merged into the subprocess env for stdio servers only. |
| `url` | string | required for `sse` / `streamableHttp` | Remote SSE / streamable HTTP endpoint URL. Not used for stdio servers. |
| `headers` | object | `{}` | Extra HTTP headers for `sse` / `streamableHttp` servers only. |
| `toolTimeout` | number | `30` | Per-tool call timeout in seconds |
| `enabledTools` | array | `["*"]` | Tool allowlist. Use `["*"]` to expose all tools from the server |

Config file location: `~/.vibe-trading/agent.json` (JSON or YAML).

For URL-based transports, `type` is required. The agent no longer guesses between SSE and streamable HTTP from the URL suffix.

### Per-session overrides (API)

When creating a session via the API you can pass `mcpServers` inside `session.config` to extend or override the global config for that session only:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "mcpServers": {
      "research-server": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["research-mcp"],
        "enabledTools": ["search", "fetch"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool naming

Ordinary remote tools are exposed with stable names: `mcp_<server>_<tool>`.
Live-broker MCP servers stay behind the `trading_*` connector surface.

If two server names produce the same ASCII-safe local prefix (e.g. `foo-bar` and `foo_bar` both become `foo_bar`), a deterministic hash suffix is appended at the server-segment level so names remain unique. The operator receives a warning:

```
WARNING: Configured MCP server 'foo-bar' collides with another server after local name
normalization. Using local tool prefix 'mcp_foo_bar_<hash>_<tool>' to keep generated
tool names unique. Rename the server in agent config if you want a different prefix.
```

### v1 limits

| Limit | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Transport | stdio, SSE, and streamable HTTP |
| Execution | serial only — MCP tools never enter the parallel readonly path |
| Surfaces | tools only (resources and prompts excluded in v1) |
| Hot reload | not supported — restart the process to pick up config changes |
| Swarm path | MCP tools are not available inside Swarm worker registries in v1 |
