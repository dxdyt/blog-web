## **🚀 Getting Started**

> **🔓 Build in Public** — Eigent is **100% open source** from day one. Every feature, every commit, every decision is transparent. We believe the best AI tools should be built openly with the community, not behind closed doors.

### 🏠 Local Deployment (Recommended)

The recommended way to run Eigent — fully standalone with complete control over your data, no cloud account required.

👉 **[Full Local Deployment Guide](./server/README_EN.md)**

This setup includes:
- Local backend server with full API
- Local model integration (vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- Complete isolation from cloud services
- Zero external dependencies

### ⚡ Quick Start (Cloud-Connected)

For a quick preview using our cloud backend — get started in seconds:

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18-22) and npm

#### Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eigent-ai/eigent.git
cd eigent
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Note: This mode connects to Eigent cloud services and requires account registration. For a fully standalone experience, use [Local Deployment](#-local-deployment-recommended) instead.

### 🏢 Enterprise

For organizations requiring maximum security, customization, and control:

- **Exclusive Features** (like SSO & custom development)
- **Scalable Enterprise Deployment**
- **Negotiated SLAs** & implementation services

## **✨ Key features**
Unlock the full potential of exceptional productivity with Eigent’s powerful features—built for seamless integration, smarter task execution, and boundless automation.

Eigent pre-defined the following agent workers:

- **Developer Agent:** Writes and executes code, runs terminal commands.
- **Browser Agent:** Searches the web and extracts content.
- **Document Agent:** Creates and manages documents.
- **Multi-Modal Agent:** Processes images and audio.

### 🧠 Comprehensive Model Support
Deploy Eigent locally with your preferred models. 

![Model](https://eigent-ai.github.io/.github/assets/gif/feature_local_model.gif)

<br/>

### 🔌 MCP Tools Integration (MCP)
Eigent comes with massive built-in **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** tools (for web browsing, code execution, Notion, Google suite, Slack etc.), and also lets you **install your own tools**. Equip agents with exactly the right tools for your scenarios – even integrate internal APIs or custom functions – to enhance their capabilities.

![MCP](https://eigent-ai.github.io/.github/assets/gif/feature_add_mcps.gif)

<br/>

### ✋ Human-in-the-Loop
If a task gets stuck or encounters uncertainty, Eigent will automatically request human input. 

![Human-in-the-loop](https://eigent-ai.github.io/.github/assets/gif/feature_human_in_the_loop.gif)

<br/>

### 👐 100% Open Source
Eigent is completely open-sourced. You can download, inspect, and modify the code, ensuring transparency and fostering a community-driven ecosystem for multi-agent innovation.
