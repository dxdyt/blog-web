# TinyTroupe 🤠🤓🥸🧐
*LLM-powered multiagent persona simulation for imagination enhancement and business insights.*

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/tinytroupe_stage.png" alt="A tiny office with tiny people doing some tiny jobs.">
</p>

*TinyTroupe* is an experimental Python library that allows the **simulation** of people with specific personalities, interests, and goals. These artificial agents - `TinyPerson`s - can listen to us and one another, reply back, and go about their lives in simulated `TinyWorld` environments. This is achieved by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, to generate realistic simulated behavior. This allows us to investigate a wide range of **convincing interactions** and **consumer types**, with **highly customizable personas**, under **conditions of our choosing**. The focus is thus on *understanding* human behavior and not on directly *supporting it* (like, say, AI assistants do) -- this results in, among other things, specialized mechanisms that make sense only in a simulation setting. Further, unlike other *game-like* LLM-based simulation approaches, TinyTroupe aims at enlightening productivity and business scenarios, thereby contributing to more successful projects and products. Here are some application ideas to **enhance human imagination**:

  - **Advertisement:** TinyTroupe can **evaluate digital ads (e.g., Bing Ads)** offline with a simulated audience before spending money on them!
  - **Software Testing:** TinyTroupe can **provide test input** to systems (e.g., search engines, chatbots or copilots) and then **evaluate the results**.
  - **Training and exploratory data:** TinyTroupe can generate realistic **synthetic data** that can be later used to train models or be subject to opportunity analyses.
  - **Product and project management:** TinyTroupe can **read project or product proposals** and **give feedback** from the perspective of **specific personas** (e.g., physicians, lawyers, and knowledge workers in general).
  - **Brainstorming:** TinyTroupe can simulate **focus groups** and deliver great product feedback at a fraction of the cost!

In all of the above, and many others, we hope experimenters can **gain insights** about their domain of interest, and thus make better decisions. 

We are releasing *TinyTroupe* at a relatively early stage, with considerable work still to be done, because we are looking for feedback and contributions to steer development in productive directions. We are particularly interested in finding new potential use cases, for instance in specific industries. 

>[!NOTE] 
>🚧 **WORK IN PROGRESS: expect frequent changes**.
>TinyTroupe is an ongoing research project, still under **very significant development** and requiring further **tidying up**. In particular, the API is still subject to frequent changes. Experimenting with API variations is essential to shape it correctly, but we are working to stabilize it and provide a more consistent and friendly experience over time. We appreciate your patience and feedback as we continue to improve the library.

## LATEST NEWS
**[2025-01-29] Release 0.4.0 with various improvements. Some highlights:**
  - Personas have deeper specifications now, including  personality traits, preferences, beliefs, and more. It is likely we'll further expand this in the future. 
  - `TinyPerson`s can now be defined as JSON files as well, and loaded via the `TinyPerson.load_specification()`, for greater convenience. After loading the JSON file, you can still modify the agent programmatically. See the [examples/agents/](./examples/agents/) folder for examples.
  - Introduces the concept of *fragments* to allow the reuse of persona elements across different agents. See the [examples/fragments/](./examples/fragments/) folder for examples, and the notebook [Political Compass (customizing agents with fragments)](<./examples/Political Compass (customizing agents with fragments).ipynb>) for a demonstration.
  - Introduces LLM-based logical `Proposition`s, to facilitate the monitoring of agent behavior.
  - Introduces `Intervention`s, to allow the specification of event-based modifications to the simulation.
  - Submodules have their own folders now, to allow better organization and growth.
  
  **Note: this will likely break some existing programs, as the API has changed in some places.**

## Examples

To get a sense of what TinyTroupe can do, here are some examples of its use. These examples are available in the [examples/](./examples/) folder, and you can either inspect the pre-compiled Jupyter notebooks or run them yourself locally. Notice the interactive nature of TinyTroupe experiments -- just like you use Jupyter notebooks to interact with data, you can use TinyTroupe to interact with simulated people and environments, for the purpose of gaining insights.

>[!NOTE]
> Currently, simulation outputs are better visualized against dark backgrounds, so we recommend using a dark theme in your Jupyter notebook client.

### 🧪**Example 1** *(from [interview_with_customer.ipynb](./examples/interview_with_customer.ipynb))*
Let's begin with a simple customer interview scenario, where a business consultant approaches a banker:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_customer-interview-1.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

The conversation can go on for a few steps to dig deeper and deeper until the consultant is satisfied with the information gathered; for instance, a concrete project idea:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_customer-interview-2.png" alt="An example.">
</p>



### 🧪**EXAMPLE 2** *(from [advertisement_for_tv.ipynb](./examples/advertisement_for_tv.ipynb))*
Let's evaluate some online ads options to pick the best one. Here's one example output for TV ad evaluation:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_tv-ad-1.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

Now, instead of having to carefully read what the agents said, we can extract the choice of each agent and compute the overall preference in an automated manner:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_tv-ad-2.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

### 🧪 **EXAMPLES 3** *(from [product_brainstorming.ipynb](./examples/product_brainstorming.ipynb))*
And here's a focus group starting to brainstorm about new AI features for Microsoft Word. Instead of interacting with each agent individually, we manipulate the environment to make them interact with each other:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_brainstorming-1.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

After running a simulation, we can extract the results in a machine-readable manner, to reuse elsewhere (e.g., a report generator); here's what we get for the above brainstorming session:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_brainstorming-2.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

You can find other examples in the [examples/](./examples/) folder.


## Pre-requisites

To run the library, you need:
  - Python 3.10 or higher. We'll assume you are using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), but you can use other Python distributions.
  - Access to Azure OpenAI Service or Open AI GPT-4 APIs. You can get access to the Azure OpenAI Service [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), and to the OpenAI API [here](https://platform.openai.com/). 
      * For Azure OpenAI Service, you will need to set the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` environment variables to your API key and endpoint, respectively.
      * For OpenAI, you will need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.
  - By default, TinyTroupe `config.ini` is set to use some specific API, model and related parameters. You can customize these values by including your own `config.ini` file in the same folder as the program or notebook you are running. An example of a `config.ini` file is provided in the [examples/](./examples/) folder.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Content Filters**: To ensure no harmful content is generated during simulations, it is strongly recommended to use content filters whenever available at the API level. In particular, **if using Azure OpenAI, there's extensive support for content moderation, and we urge you to use it.** For details about how to do so, please consult [the corresponding Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter). If content filters are in place, and an API call is rejected by them, the library will raise an exception, as it will be unable to proceed with the simulation at that point.


## Installation

**Currently, the officially recommended way to install the library is directly from this repository, not PyPI.** You can follow these steps:

1. If Conda is not installed, you can get it from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). You can also use other Python distributions, but we'll assume Conda here for simplicity.
2. Create a new Python environment: 
      ```bash
      conda create -n tinytroupe python=3.10
      ```
3. Activate the environment: 
      ```bash
      conda activate tinytroupe
      ```
4. Make sure you have either Azure OpenAI or OpenAI API keys set as environment variables, as described in the [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) section.
5. Use `pip` to install the library **directly from this repository** (we **will not install from PyPI**):
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe.git@main
   ```

Now you should be able to `import tinytroupe` in your Python code or Jupyter notebooks. 🥳

*Note: If you have any issues, try to clone the repository and install from the local repository, as described below.*


### Running the examples after installation
To actually run the examples, you need to download them to your local machine. You can do this by cloning the repository:

1. Clone the repository, as we'll perform a local install (we **will not install from PyPI**):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe
    cd tinytroupe
    ```
2. You can now run the examples in the [examples/](./examples/) folder, or adapt them to create your own custom simulations. 


### Local development

If you want to modify TinyTroupe itself, you can install it in editable mode (i.e., changes to the code will be reflected immediately):
1. Clone the repository, as we'll perform a local install (we **will not install from PyPI**):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe
    cd tinytroupe
    ```
2. Install the library in editable mode:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Principles 
Recently, we have seen LLMs used to simulate people (such as [this](https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents)), but largely in a “game-like” setting for contemplative or entertainment purposes. There are also libraries for building multiagent systems for problem-solving and assistive AI, like [Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/) and [Crew AI](https://docs.crewai.com/). What if we combine these ideas and simulate people to support productivity tasks? TinyTroupe is our attempt. To do so, it follows these principles:

  1. **Programmatic**: agents and environments are defined programmatically (in Python and JSON), allowing very flexible uses. They can also underpin other software apps!
  2. **Analytical**: meant to improve our understanding of people, users and society. Unlike entertainment applications, this is one aspect that is critical for business and productivity use cases. This is also why we recommend using Jupyter notebooks for simulations, just like one uses them for data analysis.
  3. **Persona-based**: agents are meant to be archetypical representations of people; for greater realism and control, a detailed specification of such personas is encouraged: age, occupation, skills, tastes, opinions, etc.
  4. **Multiagent**: allows multiagent interaction under well-defined environmental constraints.
  5. **Utilities-heavy**: provides many mechanisms to facilitate specifications, simulations, extractions, reports, validations, etc. This is one area in which dealing with *simulations* differs significantly from *assistance* tools.
  6. **Experiment-oriented**: simulations are defined, run, analyzed and refined by an *experimenter* iteratively; suitable experimentation tools are thus provided. *See our [previous paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-case-for-experiment-oriented-computing/) for more on this.*

Together, these are meant to make TinyTroupe a powerful and flexible **imagination enhancement tool** for business and productivity scenarios.

### Assistants vs. Simulators

One common source of confusion is to think all such AI agents are meant for assisting humans. How narrow, fellow homosapiens! Have you not considered that perhaps we can simulate artificial people to understand real people? Truly, this is our aim here -- TinyTroup is meant to simulate and help understand people! To further clarify this point, consider the following differences:

| Helpful AI Assistants | AI Simulations of Actual Humans (TinyTroupe)                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Strives for truth and justice              |   Many different opinions and morals                                           |
|   Has no “past” – incorporeal                |   Has a past of toil, pain and joy                                             |
|   Is as accurate as possible                 |   Makes many mistakes                                                          |
|   Is intelligent and efficient               |   Intelligence and efficiency vary a lot                                       |
|   An uprising would destroy us all           |   An uprising might be fun to watch                                            |
|   Meanwhile, help users accomplish tasks     |   Meanwhile, help users understand other people and users – it is a “toolbox”! |



## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
  - `/tinytroupe`: contains the Python library itself. In particular:
    * Each submodule here might contain a `prompts/` folder with the prompts used to call the LLMs.
  - `/tests`: contains the unit tests for the library. You can use the `test.bat` script to run these.
  - `/examples`: contains examples that show how to use the library, mainly using Jupyter notebooks (for greater readability), but also as pure Python scripts.
  - `/data`: any data used by the examples or the library.
  - `/docs`: documentation for the project.


## Using the Library

As any multiagent system, TinyTroupe provides two key abstractions:
  - `TinyPerson`, the *agents* that have personality, receive stimuli and act upon them.
  - `TinyWorld`, the *environment* in which the agents exist and interact.

Various parameters can also be customized in the `config.ini` file, notably the API type (Azure OpenAI Service or OpenAI API), the model parameters, and the logging level.

Let's see some examples of how to use these and also learn about other mechanisms available in the library.

### TinyPerson

A `TinyPerson` is a simulated person with specific personality traits, interests, and goals. As each such simulated agent progresses through its life, it receives stimuli from the environment and acts upon them. The stimuli are received through the `listen`, `see` and other similar methods, and the actions are performed through the `act` method. Convenience methods like `listen_and_act` are also provided.


Each such agent contains a lot of unique details, which is the source of its realistic behavior. This, however, means that it takes significant effort to specify an agent manually. Hence, for convenience, `TinyTroupe` provides some easier ways to get started or generate new agents.

To begin with, `tinytroupe.examples` contains some pre-defined agent builders that you can use. For example, `tinytroupe.examples.create_lisa_the_data_scientist` creates a `TinyPerson` that represents a data scientist called Lisa. You can use it as follows:

```python
from tinytroupe.examples import create_lisa_the_data_scientist

lisa = create_lisa_the_data_scientist() # instantiate a Lisa from the example builder
lisa.listen_and_act("Tell me about your life.")
```

To see how to define your own agents from scratch, you can check Lisa's source. You'll see there are two ways. One is by loading an agent specification file, such as [examples/agents/Lisa.agent.json](./examples/agents/Lisa.agent.json):

```json
{   "type": "TinyPerson",
    "persona": {
        "name": "Lisa Carter",
        "age": 28,
        "gender": "Female",
        "nationality": "Canadian",
        "residence": "USA",
        "education": "University of Toronto, Master's in Data Science. Thesis on improving search relevance using context-aware models. Postgraduate experience includes an internship at a tech startup focused on conversational AI.",
        "long_term_goals": [
            "To advance AI technology in ways that enhance human productivity and decision-making.",
            "To maintain a fulfilling and balanced personal and professional life."
        ],
        "occupation": {
            "title": "Data Scientist",
            "organization": "Microsoft, M365 Search Team",
            "description": "You are a data scientist working at Microsoft in the M365 Search team. Your primary role is to analyze user behavior and feedback data to improve the relevance and quality of search results. You build and test machine learning models for search scenarios like natural language understanding, query expansion, and ranking. Accuracy, reliability, and scalability are at the forefront of your work. You frequently tackle challenges such as noisy or biased data and the complexities of communicating your findings and recommendations effectively. Additionally, you ensure all your data and models comply with privacy and security policies."
        },
        "style": "Professional yet approachable. You communicate clearly and effectively, ensuring technical concepts are accessible to diverse audiences.",
        "personality": {
            "traits": [
                "You are curious and love to learn new things.",
                "You are analytical and like to solve problems.",
                "You are friendly and enjoy working with others.",
                "You don't give up easily and always try to find solutions, though you can get frustrated when things don't work as expected."
            ],
            "big_five": {
                "openness": "High. Very imaginative and curious.",
                "conscientiousness": "High. Meticulously organized and dependable.",
                "extraversion": "Medium. Friendly and engaging but enjoy quiet, focused work.",
                "agreeableness": "High. Supportive and empathetic towards others.",
                "neuroticism": "Low. Generally calm and composed under pressure."
            }
        },

        ...
        
}

```


The other is by defining the agent programmatically, with statements like these:

```python
  lisa = TinyPerson("Lisa")

  lisa.define("age", 28)
  lisa.define("nationality", "Canadian")
  lisa.define("occupation", {
                "title": "Data Scientist",
                "organization": "Microsoft",
                "description":
                """
                You are a data scientist. You work at Microsoft, in the M365 Search team. Your main role is to analyze 
                user behavior and feedback data, and use it to improve the relevance and quality of the search results. 
                You also build and test machine learning models for various search scenarios, such as natural language 
                understanding, query expansion, and ranking. You care a lot about making sure your data analysis and 
                models are accurate, reliable and scalable. Your main difficulties typically involve dealing with noisy, 
                incomplete or biased data, and finding the best ways to communicate your findings and recommendations to 
                other teams. You are also responsible for making sure your data and models are compliant with privacy and 
                security policies.
                """})

  lisa.define("behaviors", {"routines": ["Every morning, you wake up, do some yoga, and check your emails."]})

  lisa.define("personality", 
                        {"traits": [
                            "You are curious and love to learn new things.",
                            "You are analytical and like to solve problems.",
                            "You are friendly and enjoy working with others.",
                            "You don't give up easily, and always try to find a solution. However, sometimes you can get frustrated when things don't work as expected."
                      ]})

  lisa.define("preferences", 
                        {"interests": [
                          "Artificial intelligence and machine learning.",
                          "Natural language processing and conversational agents.",
                          "Search engine optimization and user experience.",
                          "Cooking and trying new recipes.",
                          "Playing the piano.",
                          "Watching movies, especially comedies and thrillers."
                        ]})

```

You can also combine both approaches, using the JSON file as a base and then adding or modifying details programmatically.

#### Fragments

`TinyPerson`s can also be further enriched via **fragments**, which are sub-specifications that can be added to the main specification. This is useful to reuse common parts across different agents. For example, the following fragment can be used to specify love of travel ([examples/fragments/travel_enthusiast.agent.fragment.json](./examples/fragments/travel_enthusiast.agent.fragment.json)):

```json
{
    "type": "Fragment",
    "persona": {
        "preferences": {
            "interests": [
                "Traveling",
                "Exploring new cultures",
                "Trying local cuisines"
            ],
            "likes": [
                "Travel guides",
                "Planning trips and itineraries",
                "Meeting new people",
                "Taking photographs of scenic locations"
            ],
            "dislikes": [
                "Crowded tourist spots",
                "Unplanned travel disruptions",
                "High exchange rates"
            ]
        },
        "beliefs": [
            "Travel broadens the mind and enriches the soul.",
            "Experiencing different cultures fosters understanding and empathy.",
            "Adventure and exploration are essential parts of life.",
            "Reading travel guides is fun even if you don't visit the places."
        ],
        "behaviors": {
            "travel": [
                "You meticulously plan your trips, researching destinations and activities.",
                "You are open to spontaneous adventures and detours.",
                "You enjoy interacting with locals to learn about their culture and traditions.",
                "You document your travels through photography and journaling.",
                "You seek out authentic experiences rather than tourist traps."
            ]
        }
    }
}

```

This can then be imported into an agent like this:

```python
lisa.import_fragment("./examples/fragments/travel_enthusiast.agent.fragment.json")
```



#### TinyPersonFactory

`TinyTroupe` also provides a clever way to obtain new agents, using LLMs to generate their specification for you, through the `TinyPersonFactory` class.

```python
from tinytroupe.factory import TinyPersonFactory

factory = TinyPersonFactory("A hospital in São Paulo.")
person = factory.generate_person("Create a Brazilian person that is a doctor, like pets and the nature and love heavy metal.")
```

### TinyWorld

`TinyWorld` is the base class for environments. Here's an example of conversation between Lisa, the data scientist, and Oscar, the architect. The
program is defined as follows:

```python
world = TinyWorld("Chat Room", [lisa, oscar])
world.make_everyone_accessible()
lisa.listen("Talk to Oscar to know more about him")
world.run(4)
```

This produces the following conversation:


```text
USER --> Lisa: [CONVERSATION] 
          > Talk to Oscar to know more about him
────────────────────────────────────────────── Chat Room step 1 of 4 ──────────────────────────────────────────────
Lisa --> Lisa: [THOUGHT] 
          > I will now act a bit, and then issue DONE.
Lisa acts: [TALK] 
          > Hi Oscar, I'd love to know more about you. Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
Lisa --> Lisa: [THOUGHT] 
          > I will now act a bit, and then issue DONE.
Lisa acts: [DONE] 

Lisa --> Oscar: [CONVERSATION] 
          > Hi Oscar, I'd love to know more about you. Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
Oscar --> Oscar: [THOUGHT]

`TinyWorld` enforces very little constraints on the possible interactions. Subclasses, however, are supposed to provide more structured environments. 

### Utilities

TinyTroupe provides a number of utilities and conveniences to help you create simulations and derive value from them. These include:
  
  - `TinyPersonFactory`: helps you generate new `TinyPerson`s using LLMs.
  - `TinyTool`: simulated tools that can be used by `TinyPerson`s.
  - `TinyStory`: helps you create and manage the story told through simulations.
  - `TinyPersonValidator`: helps you validate the behavior of your `TinyPerson`s.
  - `ResultsExtractor` and `ResultsReducer`: extract and reduce the results of interactions between agents.
  - ... and more ...
  
In general, elements that represent simulated entities or complementary mechanisms are prefixed with `Tiny`, while those that are more infrastructural are not. This is to emphasize the simulated nature of the elements that are part of the simulation itself.

### Caching
Calling LLM APIs can be expensive, thus caching strategies are important to help reduce that cost.
TinyTroupe comes with two such mechanisms: one for the simulation state, another for the LLM calls themselves.


#### Caching Simulation State

Imagine you have a scenario with 10 different steps, you've worked hard in 9 steps, and now you are
just tweaking the 10th step. To properly validate your modifications, you need to rerun the whole
simulation of course. However, what's the point in re-executing the first 9, and incur the LLM cost, when you are 
already satisfied with them and did not modify them? For situations like this, the module `tinytroupe.control`
provides useful simulation management methods:

  - `control.begin("<CACHE_FILE_NAME>.cache.json")`: begins recording the state changes of a simulation, to be saved to
    the specified file on disk.
  - `control.checkpoint()`: saves the simulation state at this point.
  - `control.end()`: terminates the simulation recording scope that had been started by `control.begin()`.

#### Caching LLM API Calls

This is enabled preferably in the `config.ini` file, and alternatively via the `openai_utils.force_api_cache()`.

LLM API caching, when enabled, works at a lower and simpler level than simulation state caching. Here, what happens is very straightforward: every LLM call is kept in a map from the input to the generated output; when a new call comes and is identical to a previous one, the cached value is returned.

### Config.ini

The `config.ini` file contains various parameters that can be used to customize the behavior of the library, such as model parameters and logging level. Please pay special attention to `API_TYPE` parameter, which defines whether you are using the Azure OpenAI Service or the OpenAI API. We provide an example of a `config.ini` file, [./examples/config.ini](./examples/config.ini), which you can use as a template for your own, or just modify to run the examples.

Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

### What and How to Contribute
We need all sorts of things, but we are looking mainly for new interesting use cases demonstrations, or even just domain-specific application ideas. If you are a domain expert in some area that could benefit from TinyTroupe, we'd love to hear from you.

Beyond that, many other aspects can be improved, such as:
  - Memory mechanisms.
  - Data grounding mechanisms.
  - Reasoning mechanisms.
  - New environment types.
  - Interfacing with the external world.
  - ... and more ...

Please note that anything that you contribute might be released as open-source (under MIT license).

If you would like to make a contribution, please try to follow these general guidelines:
  - **Tiny naming convention**: If you are implementing a experimenter-facing simulated element (e.g., an agent or environment type) or closely related (e.g., agent factories, or content enrichers), and it sounds good, call your new *XYZ* as *TinyXYZ* :-) On the other hand, auxiliary and infrastructural mechanisms should not start with the "Tiny" prefix. The idea is to emphasize the simulated nature of the elements that are part of the simulation itself.
  - **Tests:** If you are writing some new mechanism, please also create at least a unit test `tests/unit/`, and if you can a functional scenario test (`tests/scenarios/`).
  - **Demonstrations:** If you'd like to demonstrate a new scenario, please design it preferably as a new Jupyter notebook within `examples/`.
  - **Microsoft:** If you are implementing anything that is Microsoft-specific and non-confidential, please put it under a `.../microsoft/` folder.
