## What is it?

Flowsint is a graph-based investigation tool focused on reconnaissance and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). It allows you to explore relationships between entities through a visual graph interface and automated enrichers.

### Available Enrichers

**Domain Enrichers**
- Reverse DNS Resolution - Find domains pointing to an IP
- DNS Resolution - Resolve domain to IP addresses
- Subdomain Discovery - Enumerate subdomains
- WHOIS Lookup - Get domain registration information
- Domain to Website - Convert domain to website entity
- Domain to Root Domain - Extract root domain
- Domain to ASN - Find ASN associated with domain
- Domain History - Retrieve historical domain data

**IP Enrichers**
- IP Information - Get geolocation and network details
- IP to ASN - Find ASN for IP address

**ASN Enrichers**
- ASN to CIDRs - Get IP ranges for an ASN

**CIDR Enrichers**
- CIDR to IPs - Enumerate IPs in a range

**Social Media Enrichers**
- Maigret - Username search across social platforms

**Organization Enrichers**
- Organization to ASN - Find ASNs owned by organization
- Organization Information - Get company details
- Organization to Domains - Find domains owned by organization

**Cryptocurrency Enrichers**

## Project structure

The project is organized into autonomous modules:

### Core modules

- **flowsint-core**: Core utilities, orchestrator, vault, celery tasks, and base classes
- **flowsint-types**: Pydantic models and type definitions
- **flowsint-enrichers**: Enricher modules, scanning logic, and tools
- **flowsint-api**: FastAPI server, API routes, and schemas only
- **flowsint-app**: Frontend application

### Module dependencies

```
flowsint-app (frontend)
    ↓
flowsint-api (API server)
    ↓
flowsint-core (orchestrator, tasks, vault)
    ↓
flowsint-enrichers (enrichers & tools)
    ↓
flowsint-types (types)
```

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Run

Make sure you have **Make** installed.

```bash
make dev
```

### Development

The app is accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Module details

### flowsint-core

Core utilities and base classes used by all other modules:

- Database connections (PostgreSQL, Neo4j)
- Authentication and authorization
- Logging and event handling
- Configuration management
- Base classes for enrichers and tools
- Utility functions

### flowsint-types

Pydantic models for all data types:

- Domain, IP, ASN, CIDR
- Individual, Organization, Email, Phone
- Website, Social profiles, Credentials
- Crypto wallets, Transactions, NFTs
- And many more...

### flowsint-enrichers

Enricher modules that process data:

- Domain enrichers (subdomains, WHOIS, resolution)
- IP enrichers (geolocation, ASN lookup)
- Social media enrichers (Maigret, Sherlock)
- Email enrichers (breaches, Gravatar)
- Crypto enrichers (transactions, NFTs)
- And many more...

### flowsint-api

FastAPI server providing:

- REST API endpoints
- Authentication and user management
- Graph database integration
- Real-time event streaming

### flowsint-app

Frontend application.

- Modern and UI friendly interface
- Built for performance (no lag even on thousands of nodes)

## Development workflow

1. **Adding new types**: Add to `flowsint-types` module
2. **Adding new enrichers**: Add to `flowsint-enrichers` module
3. **Adding new API endpoints**: Add to `flowsint-api` module
4. **Adding new utilities**: Add to `flowsint-core` module

## Testing

Each module has its own (incomplete) test suite:

```bash
# Test core module
cd flowsint-core
poetry run pytest

# Test types module
cd ../flowsint-types
poetry run pytest

# Test enrichers module
cd ../flowsint-enrichers
poetry run pytest

# Test API module
cd ../flowsint-api
poetry run pytest
```

## Contributing

1. Follow the modular structure
2. Use Poetry for dependency management
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed
