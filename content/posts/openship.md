## Quick Start

Pick by how you work — **solo → desktop app**, **team / always-on → CLI on a server**.

### Solo — desktop app

The control plane runs on your machine and drives your servers over SSH; nothing of Openship is exposed publicly. Download, open, done — no terminal needed:

| Platform | Download |
|---|---|
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | [Openship-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/oblien/openship/releases/latest/download/Openship-arm64.dmg) |
| **macOS** (Intel) | [Openship-x64.dmg](https://github.com/oblien/openship/releases/latest/download/Openship-x64.dmg) |
| **Windows** | [Openship-win32-x64.zip](https://github.com/oblien/openship/releases/latest/download/Openship-win32-x64.zip) |
| **Linux** | [Openship.AppImage](https://github.com/oblien/openship/releases/latest/download/Openship.AppImage) |

Linux: `chmod +x Openship.AppImage && ./Openship.AppImage`. Links always point at the newest release.

### Team / always-on — CLI on a server

Install the CLI (it bundles the API + dashboard), then run **`openship`** — an interactive wizard creates the first admin, wires your domain, and installs itself as a boot service. Run it again anytime to manage the instance.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.openship.io | sh             # install  (or: npm i -g openship)
openship                                            # interactive setup, then control panel
```

For CI / headless boxes, skip the wizard and drive `openship up` directly — same background service, boots and auto-restarts:

```bash
openship up                                          # background service on this machine
openship up --public-url https://openship.example.com   # + expose on your domain (edge + TLS handled)
```

`openship open` opens the dashboard · `openship stop` stops it · `openship update` upgrades · `openship up --foreground` runs attached.

**Deploy a project:**

```bash
cd your-project
openship init          # link this directory to a project
openship deploy
```

Full server guide + complete CLI reference: **[docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)**.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: run from source with Docker Compose (not the recommended path)</summary>

Heavier than the CLI, and the compose stack gives the control-plane container access to the host Docker daemon (host-privileged) — use it only if you specifically need a containerized control plane. The CLI and desktop app above are the supported installs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oblien/openship.git && cd openship
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

## What It Does

Point it at a repo. Openship detects your stack, builds it, configures everything, and ships it — zero config files, zero pipelines, zero YAML.

Databases, domains, SSL, CDN, mail, backups — all managed from one place.

Solo devs shipping side projects and teams running production use the same tool.

## Deploy Anywhere

- **Openship Cloud** — managed, auto-scaling, zero setup
- **Any VPS** — Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Linode, OVH, and the rest
- **Dedicated servers** — bare metal, colo, homelab
- **Multi-server** — spread workloads across machines

Same interface regardless of where you deploy.

---

## Three Interfaces

- **Desktop app** — full GUI, real-time logs, one-click everything.
- **Web dashboard** — the same UI in the browser, built for teams.
- **CLI** — scriptable and CI-friendly.

A **REST API** and **MCP** (AI agent protocol) round it out for automation and tooling integration. Full command and API reference at [openship.io/docs](https://openship.io/docs).

> [!NOTE]
> The docs are still a work in progress — we're actively filling them out. If something's missing or unclear, [contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are hugely welcome and help us get there faster.

## Status

Production-ready core, actively developed.

**Coming next:** multi-node clusters, load-balancing UI, private networking, advanced monitoring, and visual CI/CD pipelines.

## Releasing

Cut a release with the version script — it syncs every package's version,
commits the bump, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes:

```bash
bun scripts/release.ts 0.2.0        # explicit version
# or a bump keyword: patch | minor | major | rc   (minor from 0.1.x → 0.2.0)
```

Pushing the tag triggers [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml), which:

- builds the **macOS / Windows / Linux installers** and the server tarballs (with SHA-256 sidecars),
- **publishes the `openship` CLI to npm** — via npm [OIDC trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) (no token), and
- creates the **GitHub Release** with the built assets (notes come from the tag).

To flag a release as **critical** (or add recommended/info advisories) in the
in-app updater, add an entry to [`release-advisories.json`](release-advisories.json)
**before** tagging — clients pull it pinned to the release tag. High-level notes
live in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
