## 🚀 Get Started

##### Download and setup Dograh on your Local Machine

> **Note**
> We collect anonymous usage data to improve the product. You can opt out by setting the `ENABLE_TELEMETRY` to `false` in the below command.

> **Note**
> If you wish to run the platform on a remote server instead, checkout our [Documentation](https://docs.dograh.com/deployment/docker#option-2:-remote-server-deployment)

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dograh-hq/dograh/main/docker-compose.yaml && REGISTRY=ghcr.io/dograh-hq ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true docker compose up --pull always
```

> **Note**
> First startup may take 2-3 minutes to download all images. Once running, open http://localhost:3010 to create your first AI voice assistant!
> For common issues and solutions, see 🔧 **[Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md)**.

### 🎙️ Your First Voice Bot

1. Open [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) in your browser.
2. Pick **Inbound** or **Outbound**, name your bot (e.g. _Lead Qualification_), and describe the use case in 5–10 words (e.g. _Screen insurance form submissions for purchase intent_).
3. Click **Web Call** — you're talking to your bot.

> 🔑 **No API keys needed.** Dograh ships with auto-generated keys and its own LLM / TTS / STT stack. Connect your own keys for LLM, TTS, STT, or Telephony (e.g. Twilio, Vonage, Telnyx) anytime.
