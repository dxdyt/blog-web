## MapUp - Excel Assessment

You have to submit an excel assessment along with your python task. This evaluation tests your proficiency in Conditional Formatting, Excel Formulae, and Data Manipulation


# Python Task 1

## Question 1: Car Matrix Generation
Under the function named `generate_car_matrix` write a logic that takes the `dataset-1.csv` as a DataFrame. Return a new DataFrame that follows the following rules:
- values from `id_2` as columns
- values from `id_1` as index
- dataframe should have values from `car` column
- diagonal values should be 0.

Sample result dataframe:\

## Question 2: Car Type Count Calculation
Create a Python function named `get_type_count` that takes the `dataset-1.csv` as a DataFrame. Add a new categorical column `car_type` based on values of the column `car`:
- `low` for values less than or equal to 15,
- `medium` for values greater than 15 and less than or equal to 25,
- `high` for values greater than 25.

Calculate the count of occurrences for each `car_type` category and return the result as a dictionary. Sort the dictionary alphabetically based on keys.

## Question 3: Bus Count Index Retrieval

Create a Python function named `get_bus_indexes` that takes the `dataset-1.csv` as a DataFrame. The function should identify and return the indices as a list (sorted in ascending order) where the `bus` values are greater than twice the mean value of the `bus` column in the DataFrame.

## Question 4: Route Filtering
Create a python function `filter_routes` that takes the `dataset-1.csv` as a DataFrame. The function should return the sorted list of values of column `route` for which the average of values of `truck` column is greater than 7.

## Question 5: Matrix Value Modification

Create a Python function named `multiply_matrix` that takes the resulting DataFrame from Question 1, as input and modifies each value according to the following logic:
- If a value in the DataFrame is greater than 20, multiply those values by 0.75,
- If a value is 20 or less, multiply those values by 1.25.

The function should return the modified DataFrame which has values rounded to 1 decimal place.

Sample result dataframe:\
 ![Task 1 Question 5](readme_images/task1-q5.png)

## Question 6: Time Check

You are given a dataset, `dataset-2.csv`, containing columns `id`, `id_2`, and timestamp (`startDay`, `startTime`, `endDay`, `endTime`). The goal is to verify the completeness of the time data by checking whether the timestamps for each unique (`id`, `id_2`) pair cover a full 24-hour period (from 12:00:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM) and span all 7 days of the week (from Monday to Sunday).

Create a function that accepts `dataset-2.csv` as a DataFrame and returns a boolean series that indicates if each (`id`, `id_2`) pair has incorrect timestamps. The boolean series must have multi-index (`id`, `id_2`).


# Python Task 2 

## Question 1: Distance Matrix Calculation

Create a function named `calculate_distance_matrix` that takes the `dataset-3.csv` as input and generates a DataFrame representing distances between IDs. 

The resulting DataFrame should have cumulative distances along known routes, with diagonal values set to 0. If distances between toll locations A to B and B to C are known, then the distance from A to C should be the sum of these distances. Ensure the matrix is symmetric, accounting for bidirectional distances between toll locations (i.e. A to B is equal to B to A). 

Sample result dataframe:\
 ![Task 2 Question 1](readme_images/task2-q1.png)

## Question 2: Unroll Distance Matrix

Create a function `unroll_distance_matrix` that takes the DataFrame created in Question 1. The resulting DataFrame should have three columns: columns `id_start`, `id_end`, and `distance`.

All the combinations except for same `id_start` to `id_end` must be present in the rows with their distance values from the input DataFrame.

## Question 3: Finding IDs within Percentage Threshold

Create a function `find_ids_within_ten_percentage_threshold` that takes the DataFrame created in Question 2 and a reference value from the `id_start` column as an integer.

Calculate average distance for the reference value given as an input and return a sorted list of values from `id_start` column which lie within 10% (including ceiling and floor) of the reference value's average.

## Question 4: Calculate Toll Rate

Create a function `calculate_toll_rate` that takes the DataFrame created in Question 2 as input and calculates toll rates based on vehicle types. 

The resulting DataFrame should add 5 columns to the input DataFrame: `moto`, `car`, `rv`, `bus`, and `truck` with their respective rate coefficients. The toll rates should be calculated by multiplying the distance with the given rate coefficients for each vehicle type: 
- 0.8 for `moto`
- 1.2 for `car`
- 1.5 for `rv`
- 2.2 for `bus`
- 3.6 for `truck`

Sample result dataframe:\
 ![Task 2 Question 4](readme_images/task2-q4.png)

## Question 5: Calculate Time-Based Toll Rates

Create a function named `calculate_time_based_toll_rates` that takes the DataFrame created in Question 4 as input and calculates toll rates for different time intervals within a day. 

The resulting DataFrame should have these five columns added to the input: start_day, start_time, end_day, and end_time.
- `start_day`, `end_day` must be strings with day values (from Monday to Sunday in proper case)
- `start_time` and `end_time` must be of type datetime.time() with the values from time range given below.

Modify the values of vehicle columns according to the following time ranges:

**Weekdays (Monday - Friday):**
- From 00:00:00 to 10:00:00: Apply a discount factor of 0.8
- From 10:00:00 to 18:00:00: Apply a discount factor of 1.2
- From 18:00:00 to 23:59:59: Apply a discount factor of 0.8

**Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
- Apply a constant discount factor of 0.7 for all times.

For each unique (`id_start`, `id_end`) pair, cover a full 24-hour period (from 12:00:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM) and span all 7 days of the week (from Monday to Sunday).
