## What Are Claude Code Skills?

Skills are modular instruction packages (plugins) that give AI coding agents domain expertise they don't have out of the box. Each skill includes a `SKILL.md` (instructions + workflows), Python CLI tools, and reference documentation — everything the agent needs to perform like a specialist.

**One repo, four platforms:** Works natively as Claude Code plugins, OpenAI Codex CLI and agents, Gemini CLI skills, and OpenClaw skills.
