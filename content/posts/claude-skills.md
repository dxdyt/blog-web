# Claude Code Skills & Plugins — Agent Skills for Every Coding Tool

**355 production-ready Claude Code skills, plugins, and agent skills for 13 AI coding tools.**

The most comprehensive open-source library of Claude Code skills and agent plugins — also works with OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and 9 more coding agents. Reusable expertise packages covering engineering, DevOps, marketing (incl. AEO — Answer Engine Optimization for LLM citation), security (PreToolUse hooks), compliance, C-level advisory (incl. founder-mode CFO/CMO/CRO/CPO/COO/CHRO/CISO/GC/CDO/CAIO/CCO/VPE personas + 21 /cs:* slash commands), productivity (capture/email/reflect), an academic research stack (litreview/grants/dossier/patent/syllabus/pulse/notebooklm/deep-research + hybrid router), and enterprise Research Operations (clinical-research/research-finance/market-research/product-research, v2.9.0).

**Works with:** Claude Code · OpenAI Codex · Gemini CLI · OpenClaw · Hermes Agent[^hermes] · Mistral Vibe[^vibe] · Cursor · Aider · Windsurf · Kilo Code · OpenCode · Augment · Antigravity

[^hermes]: Hermes Agent is **BYO-sync tier**: the repo ships a pre-generated `.hermes/skills/claude-skills/` tree, but you run `python scripts/sync-hermes-skills.py` once locally to install into `~/.hermes/skills/`. Uses the same agentskills.io SKILL.md standard — no format conversion.
[^vibe]: Mistral Vibe is also **BYO-sync tier**: the repo ships a pre-generated `.vibe/skills/claude-skills/` tree, run `./scripts/vibe-install.sh` once locally to install into `~/.vibe/skills/`. Same agentskills.io SKILL.md standard — no format conversion. Docs: <https://docs.mistral.ai/mistral-vibe/agents-skills>.

## What Are Claude Code Skills & Agent Plugins?

Claude Code skills (also called agent skills or coding agent plugins) are modular instruction packages that give AI coding agents domain expertise they don't have out of the box. Each skill includes:

- **SKILL.md** — structured instructions, workflows, and decision frameworks
- **Python tools** — 602 CLI scripts (all stdlib-only, zero pip installs)
- **Reference docs** — 711 templates, checklists, and domain-specific knowledge files

**One repo, thirteen platforms.** Works natively as Claude Code plugins, Codex agent skills, Gemini CLI skills, Hermes Agent skills, Mistral Vibe skills, and converts to more tools via `scripts/convert.sh`. All 602 Python tools run anywhere Python runs.

### Skills vs Agents vs Personas

| | Skills | Agents | Personas |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | How to execute a task | What task to do | Who is thinking |
| **Scope** | Single domain | Single domain | Cross-domain |
| **Voice** | Neutral | Professional | Personality-driven |
| **Example** | "Follow these steps for SEO" | "Run a security audit" | "Think like a startup CTO" |

All three work together. See [Orchestration](#orchestration) for how to combine them.

**How it works:**

```bash
# 1. Convert all skills to all tools (takes ~15 seconds)
./scripts/convert.sh --tool all

# 2. Install into your project (with confirmation)
./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor --target /path/to/project

# Or use --force to skip confirmation:
./scripts/install.sh --tool aider --target . --force

# 3. Verify
find .cursor/rules -name "*.mdc" | wc -l  # Should show 346
```

**Each tool gets:**
- ✅ All 345 skills converted to native format
- ✅ Per-tool README with install/verify/update steps
- ✅ Support for scripts, references, templates where applicable
- ✅ Zero manual conversion work

Run `./scripts/convert.sh --tool all` to generate tool-specific outputs locally.

## Personas

Pre-configured agent identities with curated skill loadouts, workflows, and distinct communication styles. Personas go beyond "use these skills" — they define how an agent thinks, prioritizes, and communicates.

| Persona | Domain | Best For |
|---------|--------|----------|
| [**Startup CTO**](agents/personas/startup-cto.md) | Engineering + Strategy | Architecture decisions, tech stack selection, team building, technical due diligence |
| [**Growth Marketer**](agents/personas/growth-marketer.md) | Marketing + Growth | Content-led growth, launch strategy, channel optimization, bootstrapped marketing |
| [**Solo Founder**](agents/personas/solo-founder.md) | Cross-domain | One-person startups, side projects, MVP building, wearing all hats |

**Usage:**
```bash
# Claude Code
cp agents/personas/startup-cto.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Any tool
./scripts/convert.sh --tool cursor  # Converts personas too
```

See [agents/personas/](agents/personas/) for details. Create your own with [TEMPLATE.md](agents/personas/TEMPLATE.md).

---

## Orchestration

A lightweight protocol for coordinating personas, skills, and agents on work that crosses domain boundaries. No framework required.

**Four patterns:**

| Pattern | What | When |
|---------|------|------|
| **Solo Sprint** | Switch personas across project phases | Side projects, MVPs, solo founders |
| **Domain Deep-Dive** | One persona + multiple stacked skills | Architecture reviews, compliance audits |
| **Multi-Agent Handoff** | Personas review each other's output | High-stakes decisions, launch readiness |
| **Skill Chain** | Sequential skills, no persona needed | Content pipelines, repeatable checklists |

**Example: 6-week product launch**
```
Week 1-2: startup-cto + aws-solution-architect + senior-frontend → Build
Week 3-4: growth-marketer + launch-strategy + copywriting + seo-audit → Prepare
Week 5-6: solo-founder + email-sequence + analytics-tracking → Ship and iterate
```

See [orchestration/ORCHESTRATION.md](orchestration/ORCHESTRATION.md) for the full protocol and examples.

## FAQ

**How do I install Claude Code plugins?**
Add the marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add alirezarezvani/claude-skills`, then install any skill bundle with `/plugin install <name>@claude-code-skills`.

**Do these skills work with OpenAI Codex / Cursor / Windsurf / Aider / Mistral Vibe?**
Yes. Skills work natively with 13 tools: Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, Mistral Vibe, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, Kilo Code, OpenCode, Augment, and Antigravity. Hermes Agent and Mistral Vibe both use the same agentskills.io SKILL.md standard — run `python scripts/sync-hermes-skills.py` or `./scripts/vibe-install.sh` to install. For other tools run `./scripts/convert.sh --tool all` then `./scripts/install.sh --tool <name>`. See [Multi-Tool Integrations](https://alirezarezvani.github.io/claude-skills/integrations/) for details.

**Will updating break my installation?**
No. We follow semantic versioning and maintain backward compatibility within patch releases. Existing script arguments, plugin source paths, and SKILL.md structures are never changed in patch versions. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details on each release.

**Are the Python tools dependency-free?**
Yes. All 602 Python CLI tools use the standard library only — zero pip installs required. Every script is verified to run with `--help`.

**How do I create my own Claude Code skill?**
Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` (frontmatter + instructions), optional `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`. See the [Skills & Agents Factory](https://github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-code-skills-agents-factory) for a step-by-step guide.
