What is our next release? Wan 2.2 Animate SVI. We found that tuning with only 1k samples is sufficient to unlock infinite-length generation for Wan 2.2 Animate, and we are trying to scale up now. The performance is far better than our original SVI-Dance based on UniAnimate-DiT. 


## ✨ Highlight

*Stable Video Infinity* (SVI) is able to generate ANY-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene transitions, and controllable streaming storylines in ANY domains.

- **OpenSVI**: Everything is open-sourced: training & evaluation scripts, datasets, and more.
- **Infinite Length**: No inherent limit on video duration; generate arbitrarily long stories (see the 10‑minute “Tom and Jerry” demo).
- **Versatile**: Supports diverse in-the-wild generation tasks: multi-scene short films, single‑scene animations, skeleton-/audio-conditioned generation, cartoons, and more.
- **Efficient**: Only LoRA adapters are tuned, requiring very little training data: anyone can make their own SVI easily.

## 😀 SVI 1.0 ComfyUI Workflow

### Official ComfyUI

We've recently discovered that some users have been incorrectly using SVI workflows. We apologize for any confusion. Please note that **SVI LoRA cannot directly use the original Wan 2.1 workflow** - it requires modified padding settings. 

**Please use our official workflow**: `Stable-Video-Infinity/comfyui_workflow`, which supports independent prompts for each video clip. Big thanks to @RuneGjerde, @Kijai, and @Taiwan1912!

Due to the significant impact of quantization and step distillation on the SVI-Film workflow, we currently only open-source the SVI-Shot workflow. Using our official workflow will generate infinite-length videos without drifting and forgetting. Below is a 3-minute interactive video demo (distinct prompts for each 5-second video continuation):



<div align="center">

</div>

### Some Important To-Checks
If you can’t wait for the official ComfyUI release, try the testing versions of the Shot and Film workflows first with commercial GPUs based on quantization and distill Loras: [Here](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/issues/1519#issuecomment-3447933556). The official one (more stable) might be updated soon. Due to model quantization, the video quality may be affected (Better to try more sampling steps than 4/8). 


- Please ensure that every video clip uses a different seed.
- SVI-Film uses 5 motion frames (last 5 frames) for i2v, not 1.
- SVI-Tom shares the workflow with SVI-Film, but uses 1 motion frame.
- SVI-Shot uses 1 motion frame (last frame) and uses extra VACE-based padding (the given reference image).
- Use the boat and cat demos for 50s generation and compare them with the [reproduced ones](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/issues/1519#issuecomment-3443540666) to verify correctness.
- SVI-Shot also supports using different text for clips. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1oh4q3w/wan21_svishot_lora_long_video_test_1min/). Thanks @Taiwan1912！

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Bidirectional or Causal (Self-Forcing)?


*Self-Forcing achieves **frame-by-frame causality**, whereas SVI, a hybrid version, operates with **clip-by-clip causality** and **bidirectional attention within each clip**.*

Targeting film and creative content production, our SVI design mirrors a director's workflow: (1) Directors repeatedly review clips in both forward and reverse directions to ensure quality, often calling "CUT" and "AGAIN" multiple times during the creative process. SVI maintains bidirectionality within each clip to emulate this process. (2) After that, directors seamlessly connect different clips along the temporal axis with causality (and some scene-transition animation), which aligns with SVI's clip-by-clip causality. The Self-Forcing series is better suited for scenarios prioritizing real-time interaction (e.g., gaming). In contrast, SVI focuses on story content creation, requiring higher standards for both content and visual quality. Intuitively, SVI's paradigm has unique advantages in end-to-end high-quality video content creation.

## 📌 Abstract

We propose **Stable Video Infinity (SVI)** that is able to generate infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video methods attempt to *mitigate accumulated errors* via handcrafted anti-drifting (e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI incorporates **Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning**, a new type of efficient training that recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to *actively identify and correct its own errors*. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions (e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks, including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying its versatility and state-of-the-art role.
