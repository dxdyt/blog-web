### **The self-learning, self-optimizing vector database — with graph intelligence, local AI, and PostgreSQL built in.**

> Created by [rUv](https://ruv.io) and powering [Cognitum](https://cognitum.one), a 🏅 **CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree** — the world's first Agentic Chip designed to be always running for AI agents. Tens of thousands of agents, near-zero power, learns from every signal. [Learn more →](https://cognitum.one)


```bash
npx ruvector
```

####  Most vector databases store your data and search it — the same way, every time. 

#### **RuVector** is fundamentally different. It watches how you use it and gets smarter: search results improve automatically, the system tunes itself to your workload, and it runs AI models right on your hardware — no cloud APIs, no per-query bills, GPUs optional, CPUs preferred. It drops into PostgreSQL, runs in browsers, and ships as a single file. 

Open source. ❤️ Free forever.

## How the GNN Works

Traditional vector search:
```
Query → HNSW Index → Top K Results
```

RuVector with GNN:
```
Query → HNSW Index → GNN Layer → Enhanced Results
                ↑                      │
                └──── learns from ─────┘
```

The GNN layer:
1. Takes your query and its nearest neighbors
2. Applies multi-head attention to weigh which neighbors matter
3. Updates representations based on graph structure
4. Returns better-ranked results — all in under 1ms

This is **temporal learning** — the system learns from the sequence and timing of queries, not just their content. A query asked right after another carries context. Patterns that repeat get reinforced. Paths that lead to good results get stronger over time. The result: search gets faster and more accurate the more you use it, adapting in real time without retraining.

<details>
<summary><strong>Deep Dive: How Self-Learning Search Actually Works</strong></summary>

### The Problem with Normal Search

Every vector database does the same thing: you give it a query, it finds the closest matches by distance, and returns them. The results never change. Search the same thing a thousand times and you get the same answer a thousand times — even if the first result was wrong and you always clicked the third one instead.

RuVector is different. It watches what happens *after* the search and uses that to make the next search better.

### What the GNN Actually Does

Think of your data as a city map. Each vector is a building, and the HNSW index creates roads between similar buildings. A normal search just walks the shortest road to find nearby buildings.

The GNN is like a local who knows the shortcuts. It looks at the neighborhood around your destination and says: "Yes, that building is close, but *this* one over here is what you actually want." It learns these shortcuts by watching which results people actually use.

**Technically, it works in three steps:**

| Step | What Happens | Plain English |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **1. Message Passing** | Each node collects information from its HNSW neighbors | "Ask the neighborhood what they know" |
| **2. Attention Weighting** | Multi-head attention scores which neighbors matter most for this specific query | "Some neighbors are more helpful than others — figure out which ones" |
| **3. Representation Update** | Node representations shift based on what the neighborhood says | "Update your understanding based on what you learned" |

This entire process takes **under 1ms** thanks to SIMD acceleration (processing 4-8 numbers at once instead of one at a time).

### Temporal Learning: Time Matters

Most AI systems treat every input as independent — they don't know or care what happened 5 seconds ago. RuVector tracks the *sequence* and *timing* of queries, which reveals patterns that individual queries can't:

| Pattern | What It Reveals | How RuVector Adapts |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Same user searches A then B within seconds | A and B are related, even if they're far apart in vector space | Strengthens the path between A and B |
| Many users skip result #1 and click result #3 | Result #3 is actually more relevant | GNN learns to rank #3 higher next time |
| Query bursts around a topic at certain times | Temporal relevance — some things matter more at certain times | Boosts recently-active paths |
| A query that follows a specific sequence | Context from previous queries changes what "good results" means | Attention weights shift based on session context |

### Three Types of Learning

RuVector learns at three different speeds simultaneously:

| Speed | Mechanism | What It Does | Latency |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Instant** | MicroLoRA adaptation | Adjusts weights for this specific request based on immediate feedback | <1ms |
| **Session** | GNN attention updates | Reinforces paths that led to good results during this session | ~10ms (background) |
| **Long-term** | EWC++ consolidation | Permanently strengthens important patterns without forgetting old ones | ~100ms (background) |

The key innovation is **EWC++ (Elastic Weight Consolidation)** — it solves the "catastrophic forgetting" problem. Without it, learning new patterns would erase old ones. EWC++ identifies which weights are important for existing knowledge and protects them while still allowing new learning.

### Why It's Fast: The HNSW Shortcut

The GNN doesn't run on your entire dataset. It only runs on the small subgraph of HNSW neighbors that are relevant to the current query — typically 10-50 nodes out of millions. This is why it adds under 1ms of latency instead of seconds:

```
1M vectors in your database
    → HNSW finds ~50 candidate neighbors        (0.3ms)
    → GNN re-ranks those 50 with attention       (0.4ms)
    → Return top K results                       (0.1ms)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────
    Total: <1ms, and results improve over time
```

### What Improves Over Time

| Metric | Day 1 | After 1K Queries | After 100K Queries |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Recall@10** | Baseline (HNSW only) | +5-8% | +12.4% |
| **Query latency** | ~0.8ms | ~0.7ms (hot paths cached) | ~0.5ms (optimized routing) |
| **Relevance** | Distance-based only | Learns user preferences | Personalized per query pattern |

### Three GNN Architectures (Pick One or Stack Them)

| Architecture | Best For | How It Works |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **GCN** (Graph Convolutional Network) | General-purpose re-ranking | Averages neighbor information — simple, fast, effective |
| **GAT** (Graph Attention Network) | Queries where some neighbors matter more than others | Learns *which* neighbors to pay attention to per query |
| **GraphSAGE** | Datasets that change frequently (new vectors added often) | Can score new vectors it's never seen before, without retraining |

### Runs Everywhere

The same GNN code runs natively in Rust, in Node.js via NAPI-RS bindings, and in the browser via WebAssembly. Models trained on the server can be exported and run client-side — a user's browser can do personalized re-ranking without sending queries to a server.

<summary><strong>RVF Cognitive Containers</strong> — One file that stores, boots, and proves everything</summary>

**[RVF (RuVector Format)](./crates/rvf/README.md)** is a universal binary substrate that merges database, model, graph engine, kernel, and attestation into a single deployable file. A `.rvf` file can store vector embeddings, carry LoRA adapter deltas, embed GNN graph state, include a bootable Linux microkernel, run queries in a 5.5 KB WASM runtime, and prove every operation through a cryptographic witness chain — all in one file that runs anywhere from a browser to bare metal.

This is not a database format. It is an **executable knowledge unit**.

```bash
cargo install rvf-cli                          # CLI tool
cargo add rvf-runtime                          # Rust library
npm install @ruvector/rvf                      # TypeScript SDK
npx @ruvector/rvf-mcp-server --transport stdio # MCP server for AI agents
```

| What It Does | How |
|---|---|
| Self-boot as a microservice | Real Linux kernel in the file, boots in 125 ms on QEMU/KVM |
| Hardware-speed lookups | eBPF programs (XDP, TC, socket filter) bypass userspace entirely |
| Run in any browser | 5.5 KB WASM runtime, zero backend |
| Git-like branching | COW at cluster granularity — 1M vectors, 100 edits = ~2.5 MB child |
| Tamper-evident audit | Hash-linked witness chain for every insert, query, and deletion |
| Post-quantum signatures | ML-DSA-65 and Ed25519 signing on every segment |
| DNA-style lineage | Parent/child derivation chains with cryptographic verification |
| 24 segment types | VEC, INDEX, KERNEL, EBPF, WASM, COW_MAP, WITNESS, CRYPTO, and 16 more |

<summary><strong>Sublinear-Time Solver</strong> — math that gets faster as your data gets bigger</summary>

**[ruvector-solver](./crates/ruvector-solver/README.md)** solves large math problems (like ranking pages, finding connections in graphs, or computing AI attention) in a fraction of the time traditional solvers need. Where standard approaches slow down dramatically with scale (doubling data = 8x slower), RuVector's 8 specialized algorithms barely notice the increase (doubling data = barely any slower). This is what powers the self-learning engine — fast graph math is what lets search improve in real time instead of waiting minutes to retrain.

```bash
cargo add ruvector-solver --features all-algorithms
```

| Algorithm | Complexity | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Neumann Series** | O(k · nnz) | Diagonally dominant, fast convergence |
| **Conjugate Gradient** | O(√κ · log(1/ε) · nnz) | Gold-standard SPD solver |
| **Forward Push** | O(1/ε) | Single-source PageRank |
| **Backward Push** | O(1/ε) | Reverse relevance computation |
| **Hybrid Random Walk** | O(√n/ε) | Pairwise relevance, Monte Carlo |
| **TRUE** | O(log n) amortized | Large-scale Laplacian systems |
| **BMSSP** | O(nnz · log n) | Multigrid hierarchical solve |
| **Auto Router** | Automatic | Selects optimal algorithm |

**Key optimizations**: AVX2 SIMD SpMV, fused residual kernels, bounds-check elimination, arena allocator

**Supporting crates**:
- [`ruvector-attn-mincut`](./crates/ruvector-attn-mincut/README.md) — Min-cut gating as alternative to softmax attention
- [`ruvector-coherence`](./crates/ruvector-coherence/README.md) — Coherence measurement for attention comparison
- [`ruvector-profiler`](./crates/ruvector-profiler/README.md) — Memory, power, and latency benchmarking

#### Coherence vs Confidence

| Traditional AI | Prime-Radiant |
|----------------|---------------|
| "I'm 85% confident" | "Zero contradictions found" |
| Can be confidently wrong | Knows when it doesn't know |
| Guesses about the future | Proves consistency right now |
| Trust the model | Trust the math |

#### Compute Ladder Routing

| Energy | Lane | Latency | Action |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| < 0.1 | Reflex | < 1ms | Immediate approval |
| 0.1-0.4 | Retrieval | ~10ms | Fetch more evidence |
| 0.4-0.7 | Heavy | ~100ms | Deep analysis |
| > 0.7 | Human | async | Escalate to review |

```bash
# Install coherence engine
cargo add prime-radiant

# With GPU acceleration
cargo add prime-radiant --features gpu,simd

## Compression

RuVector automatically manages memory like a CPU cache — hot data stays at full precision, cold data compresses in the background. No manual tuning required.

<details>
<summary>🗜️ Adaptive Compression Tiers</summary>

**The architecture adapts to your data.** Hot paths get full precision and maximum compute. Cold paths compress automatically and throttle resources. Recent data stays crystal clear; historical data optimizes itself in the background.

Think of it like your computer's memory hierarchy—frequently accessed data lives in fast cache, while older files move to slower, denser storage. RuVector does this automatically for your vectors:

| Access Frequency | Format | Compression | What Happens |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Hot** (>80%) | f32 | 1x | Full precision, instant retrieval |
| **Warm** (40-80%) | f16 | 2x | Slight compression, imperceptible latency |
| **Cool** (10-40%) | PQ8 | 8x | Smart quantization, ~1ms overhead |
| **Cold** (1-10%) | PQ4 | 16x | Heavy compression, still fast search |
| **Archive** (<1%) | Binary | 32x | Maximum density, batch retrieval |

**No configuration needed.** RuVector tracks access patterns and automatically promotes/demotes vectors between tiers. Your hot data stays fast; your cold data shrinks.

<details>
<summary>Formal Verification Details</summary>

**How it works:** Every vector operation produces a machine-checked proof term using lean-agentic dependent types. Proofs are constructed at compile-time semantics but execute at runtime with sub-microsecond overhead, then serialized into 82-byte attestations that can be embedded in RVF witness chains.

| Operation | Latency | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `ProofEnvironment::new()` | ~470ns | Initialize proof context with type declarations |
| `prove_dim_eq(a, b)` | ~496ns | Dimension equality proof with FxHash caching |
| `verify_batch_dimensions()` | ~11ns/vec | Batch verification for N vectors |
| `compose_chain()` | ~1.2us | Type-safe pipeline composition |
| `create_attestation()` | ~180ns | 82-byte formal proof witness |
| `FastTermArena::intern()` | ~1.6ns hit | O(1) dedup with 4-wide linear probe |
| `gated::route_proof()` | <10ns | 3-tier routing: Reflex / Standard / Deep |

**10 Exotic Application Domains** ([examples/verified-applications](./examples/verified-applications)):

1. **Autonomous Weapons Filter** — certified targeting pipeline blocks tampered sensors
2. **Medical Diagnostics** — proof-carrying ECG analysis with patient-keyed attestations
3. **Financial Order Routing** — verified trade execution with proof-hash audit trail
4. **Multi-Agent Contracts** — dimension + metric + depth contracts enforced by proof
5. **Distributed Sensor Swarm** — coherence verification across heterogeneous nodes
6. **Quantization Proof** — certify quantization error within formal tolerance bounds
7. **Verifiable Synthetic Memory** — AGI memory with per-embedding proof attestations
8. **Cryptographic Vector Signatures** — model-keyed signatures with contract matching
9. **Simulation Integrity** — proof receipt per step for reproducible physics
10. **Legal Forensics** — court-admissible replay bundles with structural invariants

```rust
use ruvector_verified::{ProofEnvironment, vector_types, proof_store};

let mut env = ProofEnvironment::new();
let proof = vector_types::prove_dim_eq(&mut env, 384, 384).unwrap();
let att = proof_store::create_attestation(&env, proof);
assert_eq!(att.to_bytes().len(), 82); // 82-byte formal witness
```

</details>

**Self-booting example** — the `claude_code_appliance` builds a complete AI dev environment as one file:

```bash
cd examples/rvf && cargo run --example claude_code_appliance
```

Final file: **5.1 MB single `.rvf`** — boots Linux, serves queries, runs Claude Code. One file. Boots on QEMU/Firecracker. Runs SSH. Serves vectors. Installs Claude Code. Proves every step with a cryptographic witness chain.

### Graph Transformer

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ruvector-graph-transformer.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/ruvector-graph-transformer)

| Crate | Description | Registry |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [ruvector-graph-transformer](./crates/ruvector-graph-transformer) | Unified graph transformer with proof-gated mutation substrate (8 modules, 186 tests) | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ruvector-graph-transformer.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/ruvector-graph-transformer) |
| [ruvector-graph-transformer-wasm](./crates/ruvector-graph-transformer-wasm) | WASM bindings for browser-side graph transformers | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ruvector-graph-transformer-wasm.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/ruvector-graph-transformer-wasm) |
| [ruvector-graph-transformer-node](./crates/ruvector-graph-transformer-node) | Node.js NAPI-RS bindings (22+ methods, 20 tests) | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ruvector/graph-transformer.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/graph-transformer) |

**What it does:** Every time you modify a graph — adding a node, changing an edge weight, updating a vector — the graph transformer requires a formal proof that the operation is valid *before* it executes. Think of it like a type system for graph mutations: you can't accidentally corrupt your data because the system mathematically verifies every change.

On top of that proof layer, 8 specialized modules handle different aspects of graph intelligence:

| Module | What It Does (Plain English) | Feature Flag |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------|
| **Proof-Gated Mutation** | Locks graph data behind mathematical proofs — no proof, no access | always on |
| **Sublinear Attention** | Finds the most important nodes without checking every single one — scales to millions | `sublinear` |
| **Physics-Informed** | Applies physics equations (conservation of energy, symmetry) to message passing | `physics` |
| **Biological** | Models neurons that only fire when excited enough — naturally sparse, energy-efficient | `biological` |
| **Self-Organizing** | Graphs that grow and reorganize themselves like biological development | `self-organizing` |
| **Verified Training** | Training with a receipt — if a gradient step would break an invariant, it's automatically rolled back | `verified-training` |
| **Manifold** | Operates in curved spaces (like the surface of a sphere) instead of just flat Euclidean space | `manifold` |
| **Temporal-Causal** | Enforces that information flows forward in time — no peeking at the future | `temporal` |
| **Economic** | Uses game theory to allocate attention fairly — Nash equilibrium for node importance | `economic` |

```bash
# Rust
cargo add ruvector-graph-transformer --features full

# Node.js
npm install @ruvector/graph-transformer
```

```rust
use ruvector_graph_transformer::sublinear_attention::SublinearGraphAttention;
use ruvector_graph_transformer::config::SublinearConfig;

let attn = SublinearGraphAttention::new(128, SublinearConfig::default());
let outputs = attn.lsh_attention(&features).unwrap(); // O(n log n)
```

```javascript
const { GraphTransformer } = require('@ruvector/graph-transformer');
const gt = new GraphTransformer();

// Every operation produces a proof receipt
const proof = gt.proveDimension(128, 128);
const attestation = gt.createAttestation(proof.proof_id); // 82 bytes
```

<details>
<summary>Graph Transformer Architecture Details</summary>

**Proof-gated mutation** means `state_n -> proof(invariant) -> mutation -> state_n+1`. The `ProofGate<T>` type wraps any value so you literally cannot access the inner data without first producing a valid proof. This is enforced at the type level in Rust and at runtime in WASM/Node.js.

**Sublinear attention** uses three strategies: (1) locality-sensitive hashing groups similar nodes into buckets, (2) personalized PageRank samples the most relevant neighbors via random walks, (3) spectral sparsification prunes edges that don't contribute to graph connectivity. All three reduce O(n^2) full attention to O(n log n).

**Verified training** uses a delta-apply architecture: gradients go to a scratch buffer first, invariants are checked against the proposed weights (loss stability, weight norms, Lipschitz bounds, energy gates), and only if all checks pass are the weights committed. If any check fails and `fail_closed = true`, the step is rejected and the old weights are preserved. Every successful step produces a `TrainingCertificate` with BLAKE3 hashes of weights, config, and dataset manifest.

**10 ADRs** document every design decision: [ADR-046](./docs/adr/ADR-046-graph-transformer-architecture.md) through [ADR-055](./docs/adr/ADR-055-manifold-graph-layers.md).

**Make your queries faster automatically.** RuVector DAG learns from every query execution and continuously optimizes performance—no manual tuning required.

- **7 Attention Mechanisms**: Automatically selects the best strategy (Topological, Causal Cone, Critical Path, MinCut Gated, etc.)
- **SONA Learning**: Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture adapts in <100μs per query
- **MinCut Control**: Rising "tension" triggers automatic strategy switching and predictive healing
- **50-80% Latency Reduction**: Queries improve over time without code changes

```rust
use ruvector_dag::{QueryDag, OperatorNode};
use ruvector_dag::attention::{AttentionSelector, SelectionPolicy};

let mut dag = QueryDag::new();
let scan = dag.add_node(OperatorNode::hnsw_scan(0, "vectors_idx", 64));
let filter = dag.add_node(OperatorNode::filter(1, "score > 0.5"));
dag.add_edge(scan, filter).unwrap();

// System learns which attention mechanism works best
let selector = AttentionSelector::new();
let scores = selector.select_and_apply(SelectionPolicy::Adaptive, &dag)?;
```

<summary><strong>🔀 Self-Learning DAG (Query Optimization)</strong></summary>

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/ruvector-dag.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/ruvector-dag)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ruvector/rudag.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruvector/rudag)

**Make your queries faster automatically.** RuVector DAG learns from every query execution and continuously optimizes performance—no manual tuning required.

### What is RuVector DAG?

A **self-learning query optimization system**—like a "nervous system" for your database queries that:

1. **Watches** how queries execute and identifies bottlenecks
2. **Learns** which optimization strategies work best for different query patterns
3. **Adapts** in real-time, switching strategies when conditions change
4. **Heals** itself by detecting anomalies and fixing problems before they impact users

Unlike traditional query optimizers that use static rules, RuVector DAG learns from actual execution patterns and gets smarter over time.

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | What It Does | Result |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Automatic Improvement** | Queries get faster without code changes | **50-80% latency reduction** after learning |
| **Zero-Downtime Adaptation** | Adapts to pattern changes automatically | No manual index rebuilds |
| **Predictive Prevention** | Detects rising "tension" early | Intervenes *before* slowdowns |
| **Works Everywhere** | PostgreSQL, Browser (58KB WASM), Embedded | Universal deployment |

### Use Cases

| Use Case | Why RuVector DAG Helps |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Vector Search Applications** | Optimize similarity searches that traditional databases struggle with |
| **High-Traffic APIs** | Automatically adapt to changing query patterns throughout the day |
| **Real-Time Analytics** | Learn which aggregation paths are fastest for your specific data |
| **Edge/Embedded Systems** | 58KB WASM build runs in browsers and IoT devices |
| **Multi-Tenant Platforms** | Learn per-tenant query patterns without manual tuning |

### How It Works

```
Query comes in → DAG analyzes execution plan → Best attention mechanism selected
                                                          ↓
Query executes → Results returned → Learning system records what worked
                                                          ↓
                    Next similar query benefits from learned optimizations
```

The system maintains a **MinCut tension** score that acts as a health indicator. When tension rises, the system automatically switches to more aggressive optimization strategies and triggers predictive healing.

### 7 DAG Attention Mechanisms

| Mechanism | When to Use | Trigger |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Topological** | Default baseline | Low variance |
| **Causal Cone** | Downstream impact analysis | Write-heavy patterns |
| **Critical Path** | Latency-bound queries | p99 > 2x p50 |
| **MinCut Gated** | Bottleneck-aware weighting | Cut tension rising |
| **Hierarchical Lorentz** | Deep hierarchical queries | Depth > 10 |
| **Parallel Branch** | Wide parallel execution | Branch count > 3 |
| **Temporal BTSP** | Time-series workloads | Temporal patterns |

### Quick Start

**Rust:**
```rust
use ruvector_dag::{QueryDag, OperatorNode, OperatorType};
use ruvector_dag::attention::{TopologicalAttention, DagAttention};

// Build a query DAG
let mut dag = QueryDag::new();
let scan = dag.add_node(OperatorNode::hnsw_scan(0, "vectors_idx", 64));
let filter = dag.add_node(OperatorNode::filter(1, "score > 0.5"));
let result = dag.add_node(OperatorNode::new(2, OperatorType::Result));

dag.add_edge(scan, filter).unwrap();
dag.add_edge(filter, result).unwrap();

// Compute attention scores
let attention = TopologicalAttention::new(Default::default());
let scores = attention.forward(&dag).unwrap();
```

**Node.js:**
```javascript
import { QueryDag, TopologicalAttention } from '@ruvector/rudag';

// Build DAG
const dag = new QueryDag();
const scan = dag.addNode({ type: 'hnsw_scan', table: 'vectors', k: 64 });
const filter = dag.addNode({ type: 'filter', condition: 'score > 0.5' });
dag.addEdge(scan, filter);

// Apply attention
const attention = new TopologicalAttention();
const scores = attention.forward(dag);
console.log('Attention scores:', scores);
```

**Browser (WASM - 58KB):**
```html
<script type="module">
import init, { QueryDag, TopologicalAttention } from '@ruvector/rudag-wasm';

await init();
const dag = new QueryDag();
// ... same API as Node.js
</script>
```

### SONA Learning Integration

SONA (Self-Optimizing Neural Architecture) runs post-query in background, never blocking execution:

```rust
use ruvector_dag::sona::{DagSonaEngine, SonaConfig};

let config = SonaConfig {
    embedding_dim: 256,
    lora_rank: 2,           // Rank-2 for <100μs updates
    ewc_lambda: 5000.0,     // Catastrophic forgetting prevention
    trajectory_capacity: 10_000,
};
let mut sona = DagSonaEngine::new(config);

// Pre-query: Get enhanced embedding (fast path)
let enhanced = sona.pre_query(&dag);

// Execute query...
let execution_time = execute_query(&dag);

// Post-query: Record trajectory (async, background)
sona.post_query(&dag, execution_time, baseline_time, "topological");
```

### Self-Healing

Reactive (Z-score anomaly detection) + Predictive (rising MinCut tension triggers early intervention):

```rust
use ruvector_dag::healing::{HealingOrchestrator, AnomalyConfig, PredictiveConfig};

let mut orchestrator = HealingOrchestrator::new();

// Reactive: Z-score anomaly detection
orchestrator.add_detector("query_latency", AnomalyConfig {
    z_threshold: 3.0,
    window_size: 100,
    min_samples: 10,
});

// Predictive: Rising cut tension triggers early intervention
orchestrator.enable_predictive(PredictiveConfig {
    tension_threshold: 0.6,    // Intervene before 0.7 crisis
    variance_threshold: 1.5,   // Rising variance = trouble coming
    lookahead_window: 50,      // Predict 50 queries ahead
});
```

### Query Convergence Example

A slow query converges over several runs:

```text
[run 1] query: SELECT * FROM vectors WHERE embedding <-> $1 < 0.5
        attention: topological (default)
        mincut_tension: 0.23
        latency: 847ms (improvement: 0.4%)

[run 4] mincut_tension: 0.71 > 0.7 (THRESHOLD)
        --> switching attention: topological -> mincut_gated
        latency: 412ms (improvement: 51.5%)

[run 10] attention: mincut_gated
         mincut_tension: 0.22 (stable)
         latency: 156ms (improvement: 81.6%)
```

### Performance Targets

| Component | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Attention (100 nodes) | <100μs | All 7 mechanisms |
| MicroLoRA adaptation | <100μs | Rank-2, per-operator |
| Pattern search (10K) | <2ms | K-means++ indexing |
| MinCut update | O(n^0.12) | Subpolynomial amortized |
| Anomaly detection | <50μs | Z-score, streaming |
| WASM size | 58KB | Gzipped, browser-ready |

### Dynamic Embedding Fine-Tuning

RuvLLM's adaptive learning system enables real-time model improvement without retraining.

| Feature | Description | Latency |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **MicroLoRA** | Per-request adaptation (rank 1-2), <50KB adapters | <1ms |
| **Contrastive Training** | Triplet loss with hard negatives for embedding optimization | Batch |
| **Task-Specific Adapters** | Pre-tuned for Coder, Researcher, Security, Architect, Reviewer | Hot-swap |

```javascript
// Contrastive fine-tuning for agent routing
import { ContrastiveTrainer } from '@ruvector/ruvllm';

const trainer = new ContrastiveTrainer({
  margin: 0.5,
  hardNegativeRatio: 0.7
});

// Learn: task → correct agent, not wrong agent
trainer.addTriplet(taskEmb, correctAgentEmb, wrongAgentEmb, true);
const model = trainer.train();
```

```rust
// Task-specific adapter hot-swapping
use ruvllm::lora::RuvLtraAdapters;

let adapters = RuvLtraAdapters::new();
let coder = adapters.create_lora("coder", 768)?;      // Rank 16, code patterns
let security = adapters.create_lora("security", 768)?; // Rank 16, vulnerability detection

// Hot-swap at runtime without model reload
orchestrator.set_adapter(coder);
let code_response = orchestrator.query("Implement binary search").await?;

orchestrator.set_adapter(security);
let audit_response = orchestrator.query("Audit this code for vulnerabilities").await?;
```

<summary><strong>🗜️ REFRAG - Compress-Sense-Expand RAG</strong></summary>

### What is REFRAG?

REFRAG implements the **Compress-Sense-Expand architecture** from [arXiv:2509.01092](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01092), achieving **~30x RAG latency reduction** by storing pre-computed representation tensors instead of raw text.

### Architecture

```
┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐
│   COMPRESS     │───▶│     SENSE      │───▶│    EXPAND      │
│    Layer       │    │     Layer      │    │    Layer       │
└────────────────┘    └────────────────┘    └────────────────┘

Binary tensor         Policy network        Dimension projection
storage with          decides COMPRESS      (768 → 4096 dims)
zero-copy access      vs EXPAND
```

### Compression Strategies

| Strategy | Compression | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `None` | 1x | Maximum precision |
| `Float16` | 2x | Good balance |
| `Int8` | 4x | Memory constrained |
| `Binary` | 32x | Extreme compression |

### Policy Networks

| Policy | Latency | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `ThresholdPolicy` | ~2μs | Cosine similarity threshold |
| `LinearPolicy` | ~5μs | Single layer classifier |
| `MLPPolicy` | ~15μs | Two-layer neural network |

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run demo
cargo run --bin refrag-demo

# Run benchmarks
cargo run --bin refrag-benchmark --release
```

```rust
use refrag_pipeline_example::{RefragStore, RefragEntry};

// Create REFRAG-enabled store
let store = RefragStore::new(384, 768)?;

// Insert with representation tensor
let entry = RefragEntry::new("doc_1", search_vector, "The quick brown fox...")
    .with_tensor(tensor_bytes, "llama3-8b");
store.insert(entry)?;

// Hybrid search (policy-based COMPRESS/EXPAND)
let results = store.search_hybrid(&query, 10, Some(0.85))?;

for result in results {
    match result.response_type {
        RefragResponseType::Compress => {
            // Tensor directly injectable into LLM context
            println!("Tensor: {} dims", result.tensor_dims.unwrap());
        }
        RefragResponseType::Expand => {
            // Original text when full context needed
            println!("Text: {}", result.content.unwrap());
        }
    }
}
```

## Self-Learning Systems

<details>
<summary>🧠 Self-Learning Intelligence Hooks</summary>

**Make your AI assistant smarter over time.**

When you use Claude Code (or any AI coding assistant), it starts fresh every session. It doesn't remember which approaches worked, which files you typically edit together, or what errors you've seen before.

**RuVector Hooks fixes this.** It's a lightweight intelligence layer that:

1. **Remembers what works** — Tracks which agent types succeed for different tasks
2. **Learns from mistakes** — Records error patterns and suggests fixes you've used before
3. **Predicts your workflow** — Knows that after editing `api.rs`, you usually edit `api_test.rs`
4. **Coordinates teams** — Manages multi-agent swarms for complex tasks

Think of it as giving your AI assistant a memory and intuition about your codebase.

#### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Claude Code    │────▶│  RuVector Hooks  │────▶│   Intelligence  │
│  (PreToolUse)   │     │   (pre-edit)     │     │      Layer      │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                                                         │
         ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Q-Learning    │     │  Vector Memory   │     │  Swarm Graph    │
│   α=0.1 γ=0.95  │     │  64-dim embed    │     │  Coordination   │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

The hooks integrate with Claude Code's event system:
- **PreToolUse** → Provides guidance before edits (agent routing, related files)
- **PostToolUse** → Records outcomes for learning (success/failure, patterns)
- **SessionStart/Stop** → Manages session state and metrics export

#### Technical Specifications

| Component | Implementation | Details |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Q-Learning** | Temporal Difference | α=0.1, γ=0.95, ε=0.1 (ε-greedy exploration) |
| **Embeddings** | Hash-based vectors | 64 dimensions, normalized, cosine similarity |
| **LRU Cache** | `lru` crate | 1000 entries, ~10x faster Q-value lookups |
| **Compression** | `flate2` gzip | 70-83% storage reduction, fast compression |
| **Storage** | JSON / PostgreSQL | Auto-fallback, 5000 memory entry limit |
| **Cross-platform** | Rust + TypeScript | Windows (USERPROFILE), Unix (HOME) |

#### Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Q-value lookup (cached) | <1µs |
| Q-value lookup (uncached) | ~50µs |
| Memory search (1000 entries) | <5ms |

```

#### Tutorial: Claude Code Integration

**1. Initialize and install hooks:**

```bash
ruvector hooks init
ruvector hooks install --settings-dir .claude
```

This creates `.claude/settings.json` with hook configurations:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit", "hooks": ["ruvector hooks pre-edit \"$TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH\""] },
      { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": ["ruvector hooks pre-command \"$TOOL_INPUT_COMMAND\""] }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit", "hooks": ["ruvector hooks post-edit ... --success"] },
      { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": ["ruvector hooks post-command ... --success"] }
    ],
    "SessionStart": ["ruvector hooks session-start"],
    "Stop": ["ruvector hooks session-end --export-metrics"],
    "PreCompact": ["ruvector hooks pre-compact"]
  }
}
```

**All 7 Claude Code hooks covered:**
| Hook | When It Fires | What RuVector Does |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before file edit, command, or Task | Suggests agent, shows related files, validates agent assignments |
| `PostToolUse` | After file edit or command | Records outcome, updates Q-values, injects context |
| `SessionStart` | When session begins/resumes | Loads intelligence, shows stats (startup vs resume) |
| `Stop` | When session ends | Saves state, exports metrics |
| `PreCompact` | Before context compaction | Preserves critical memories (auto vs manual) |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Before processing user prompt | Injects learned patterns as context |
| `Notification` | On system notifications | Tracks notification patterns |

**Advanced Features:**
- **Stdin JSON Parsing**: Hooks receive full JSON via stdin (session_id, tool_input, tool_response)
- **Context Injection**: PostToolUse returns `additionalContext` to inject into Claude's context
- **Timeout Optimization**: All hooks have optimized timeouts (1-5 seconds vs 60s default)

**2. Use routing for intelligent agent selection:**

```bash
# Route a task to the best agent
$ ruvector hooks route "implement vector search" --file src/lib.rs
{
  "recommended": "rust-developer",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "learned from 47 similar edits"
}
```

**3. Learn from outcomes:**

```bash
# Record successful outcome
ruvector hooks learn "edit-rs-lib" "rust-developer" --reward 1.0

# Record failed outcome
ruvector hooks learn "edit-rs-lib" "typescript-dev" --reward -0.5
```

**4. Get error fix suggestions:**

```bash
$ ruvector hooks suggest-fix E0308
{
  "code": "E0308",
  "type": "type_mismatch",
  "fixes": [
    "Check return type matches function signature",
    "Use .into() or .as_ref() for type conversion",
    "Verify generic type parameters"
  ]
}
```

#### Tutorial: Swarm Coordination

**1. Register agents:**

```bash
ruvector hooks swarm-register agent-1 rust-developer --capabilities "rust,async,testing"
ruvector hooks swarm-register agent-2 typescript-dev --capabilities "ts,react,node"
ruvector hooks swarm-register agent-3 reviewer --capabilities "review,security,performance"
```

**2. Record coordination patterns:**

```bash
# Agent-1 hands off to Agent-3 for review
ruvector hooks swarm-coordinate agent-1 agent-3 --weight 0.9
```

**3. Optimize task distribution:**

```bash
$ ruvector hooks swarm-optimize "implement-api,write-tests,code-review"
{
  "assignments": {
    "implement-api": "agent-1",
    "write-tests": "agent-1",
    "code-review": "agent-3"
  }
}
```

**4. Handle failures with self-healing:**

```bash
# Mark agent as failed and redistribute
ruvector hooks swarm-heal agent-2
```

#### PostgreSQL Storage (Optional)

For production deployments, use PostgreSQL instead of JSON files:

```bash
# Set connection URL
export RUVECTOR_POSTGRES_URL="postgres://user:pass@localhost/ruvector"

# Initialize PostgreSQL schema (automatic)
ruvector hooks init --postgres

# Or apply schema manually
psql $RUVECTOR_POSTGRES_URL -f crates/ruvector-cli/sql/hooks_schema.sql

# Build CLI with postgres feature
cargo build -p ruvector-cli --features postgres
```

The PostgreSQL backend provides:
- Vector embeddings with native `ruvector` type
- Q-learning functions (`ruvector_hooks_update_q`, `ruvector_hooks_best_action`)
- Swarm coordination tables with foreign key relationships
- Automatic memory cleanup (keeps last 5000 entries)

<summary>🔗 ONNX Embeddings</summary>

| Example | Description | Path |
|---------|-------------|------|
| [ruvector-onnx-embeddings](./examples/onnx-embeddings) | Production-ready ONNX embedding generation in pure Rust | `examples/onnx-embeddings` |

**ONNX Embeddings** provides native embedding generation using ONNX Runtime — no Python required. Supports 8+ pretrained models (all-MiniLM, BGE, E5, GTE), multiple pooling strategies, GPU acceleration (CUDA, TensorRT, CoreML, WebGPU), and direct RuVector index integration for RAG pipelines.

```rust
use ruvector_onnx_embeddings::{Embedder, PretrainedModel};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create embedder with default model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
    let mut embedder = Embedder::default_model().await?;

    // Generate embedding (384 dimensions)
    let embedding = embedder.embed_one("Hello, world!")?;

    // Compute semantic similarity
    let sim = embedder.similarity(
        "I love programming in Rust",
        "Rust is my favorite language"
    )?;
    println!("Similarity: {:.4}", sim); // ~0.85

    Ok(())
}
```

**Supported Models:**
| Model | Dimension | Speed | Best For |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| `AllMiniLmL6V2` | 384 | Fast | General purpose (default) |
| `BgeSmallEnV15` | 384 | Fast | Search & retrieval |
| `AllMpnetBaseV2` | 768 | Accurate | Production RAG |

<summary>🎓 Tutorials</summary>

### Tutorial 1: Vector Search in 60 Seconds

```javascript
import { VectorDB } from 'ruvector';

// Create DB with 384-dimensional vectors
const db = new VectorDB(384);

// Add vectors
db.insert('doc1', [0.1, 0.2, ...]);  // 384 floats
db.insert('doc2', [0.3, 0.1, ...]);

// Search (returns top 5 nearest neighbors)
const results = db.search(queryVector, 5);
// -> [{ id: 'doc1', score: 0.95 }, { id: 'doc2', score: 0.87 }]
```

### Tutorial 2: Graph Queries with Cypher

```javascript
import { GraphDB } from 'ruvector';

const graph = new GraphDB();

// Create nodes and relationships
graph.query(`
  CREATE (a:Person {name: 'Alice', embedding: $emb1})
  CREATE (b:Person {name: 'Bob', embedding: $emb2})
  CREATE (a)-[:KNOWS {since: 2020}]->(b)
`, { emb1: aliceVector, emb2: bobVector });

// Hybrid query: graph traversal + vector similarity
const results = graph.query(`
  MATCH (p:Person)-[:KNOWS*1..3]->(friend)
  WHERE vector.similarity(friend.embedding, $query) > 0.8
  RETURN friend.name, vector.similarity(friend.embedding, $query) as score
  ORDER BY score DESC
`, { query: queryVector });
```

### Tutorial 3: Self-Learning with SONA

```rust
use ruvector_sona::{SonaEngine, SonaConfig};

// Initialize SONA with LoRA adapters
let sona = SonaEngine::with_config(SonaConfig {
    hidden_dim: 256,
    lora_rank: 8,
    ewc_lambda: 0.4,  // Elastic Weight Consolidation
    ..Default::default()
});

// Record successful action
let mut trajectory = sona.begin_trajectory(query_embedding);
trajectory.add_step(result_embedding, vec![], 1.0);  // reward=1.0
sona.end_trajectory(trajectory, true);  // success=true

// SONA learns and improves future predictions
sona.force_learn();

// Later: get improved predictions
let prediction = sona.predict(&new_query_embedding);
```

### Tutorial 4: Dynamic Min-Cut (n^0.12 Updates)

```rust
use ruvector_mincut::{DynamicMinCut, Graph};

// Build graph
let mut graph = Graph::new(100);  // 100 nodes
graph.add_edge(0, 1, 10.0);
graph.add_edge(1, 2, 5.0);
graph.add_edge(0, 2, 15.0);

// Compute initial min-cut
let mut mincut = DynamicMinCut::new(&graph);
let (value, cut_edges) = mincut.compute();
println!("Min-cut value: {}", value);  // -> 15.0

// Dynamic update - subpolynomial time O(n^0.12)!
graph.update_edge(1, 2, 20.0);
let (new_value, _) = mincut.recompute();  // Much faster than recomputing from scratch
```

### Tutorial 5: 39 Attention Mechanisms

```rust
use ruvector_attention::{
    Attention, FlashAttention, LinearAttention,
    HyperbolicAttention, GraphAttention, MinCutGatedAttention
};

// FlashAttention - O(n) memory, fastest for long sequences
let flash = FlashAttention::new(512, 8);  // dim=512, heads=8
let output = flash.forward(&query, &key, &value);

// LinearAttention - O(n) time complexity
let linear = LinearAttention::new(512, 8);

// HyperbolicAttention - for hierarchical data (Poincaré ball)
let hyper = HyperbolicAttention::new(512, 8, Curvature(-1.0));

// GraphAttention - respects graph structure
let gat = GraphAttention::new(512, 8, &adjacency_matrix);

// MinCutGatedAttention - 50% compute reduction via sparsity
let mincut_gated = MinCutGatedAttention::new(512, 8, sparsity: 0.5);
let sparse_output = mincut_gated.forward(&query, &key, &value);
```

### Tutorial 6: Spiking Neural Networks

```javascript
import { SpikingNetwork, HDCEncoder } from '@ruvector/spiking-neural';

// High-Dimensional Computing encoder (10K-bit vectors)
const encoder = new HDCEncoder(10000);
const encoded = encoder.encode("hello world");

// Spiking network with BTSP learning
const network = new SpikingNetwork({
  layers: [784, 256, 10],
  learning: 'btsp',  // Behavioral Time-Scale Plasticity
  threshold: 1.0
});

// Train with spike timing
network.train(spikes, labels, { epochs: 10 });

// Inference
const output = network.forward(inputSpikes);
```

### Tutorial 7: Claude Code Hooks Integration

```bash
# 1. Initialize hooks
npx @ruvector/cli hooks init

# 2. Install into Claude settings
npx @ruvector/cli hooks install

# 3. Hooks now capture:
#    - File edits (pre/post)
#    - Commands (pre/post)
#    - Sessions (start/end)
#    - Errors and fixes

# 4. Query learned patterns
npx @ruvector/cli hooks recall "authentication error"
# -> Returns similar past solutions

# 5. Get AI routing suggestions
npx @ruvector/cli hooks route "implement caching"
# -> Suggests: rust-developer (confidence: 0.89)
```

### Tutorial 8: Edge Deployment with rvLite

```javascript
import { RvLite } from '@ruvector/rvlite';

// Create persistent edge database (IndexedDB in browser)
const db = await RvLite.create({
  path: 'my-vectors.db',
  dimensions: 384
});

// Works offline - all computation local
await db.insert('doc1', embedding1, { title: 'Hello' });
await db.insert('doc2', embedding2, { title: 'World' });

// Semantic search with metadata filtering
const results = await db.search(queryEmbedding, {
  limit: 10,
  filter: { title: { $contains: 'Hello' } }
});

// Sync when online
await db.sync('https://api.example.com/vectors');
```

<summary>🎓 RuvLLM Training & RLM Fine-Tuning Tutorials </summary>

#### Hybrid Routing (90% Accuracy)

RuvLTRA achieves **90% routing accuracy** using a keyword-first strategy with embedding fallback:

```javascript
// Optimal routing: Keywords first, embeddings as tiebreaker
function routeTask(task, taskEmbedding, agentEmbeddings) {
  const keywordScores = getKeywordScores(task);
  const maxKw = Math.max(...Object.values(keywordScores));

  if (maxKw > 0) {
    const candidates = Object.entries(keywordScores)
      .filter(([_, score]) => score === maxKw)
      .map(([agent]) => agent);

    if (candidates.length === 1) return { agent: candidates[0] };
    return pickByEmbedding(candidates, taskEmbedding, agentEmbeddings);
  }

  return embeddingSimilarity(taskEmbedding, agentEmbeddings);
}
```

Run the benchmark: `node npm/packages/ruvllm/scripts/hybrid-model-compare.js`

#### Generate Training Data

```bash
# Using CLI (recommended)
npx @ruvector/ruvllm train stats              # View dataset statistics
npx @ruvector/ruvllm train dataset            # Export training data
npx @ruvector/ruvllm train contrastive        # Run full training pipeline

# With options
npx @ruvector/ruvllm train dataset --output ./my-training
npx @ruvector/ruvllm train contrastive --epochs 20 --batch-size 32 --lr 0.0001
```

**Programmatic API:**
```javascript
import { ContrastiveTrainer, generateTrainingDataset, getDatasetStats } from '@ruvector/ruvllm';

const stats = getDatasetStats();
console.log(`${stats.totalExamples} examples, ${stats.agentTypes} agent types`);

const trainer = new ContrastiveTrainer({ epochs: 10, margin: 0.5 });
trainer.addTriplet(anchor, anchorEmb, positive, positiveEmb, negative, negativeEmb, true);
const result = trainer.train();
trainer.exportTrainingData('./output');
```

#### Fine-Tune with LoRA

```bash
pip install transformers peft datasets accelerate

python -m peft.lora_train \
  --model_name Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
  --dataset ./data/training/routing-examples.jsonl \
  --output_dir ./ruvltra-routing-lora \
  --lora_r 8 --lora_alpha 16 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --learning_rate 2e-4
```

#### Convert to GGUF

```bash
# Merge LoRA weights
python -c "
from peft import PeftModel
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
base = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct')
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base, './ruvltra-routing-lora')
model.merge_and_unload().save_pretrained('./ruvltra-routing-merged')
"

# Convert and quantize
python llama.cpp/convert_hf_to_gguf.py ./ruvltra-routing-merged --outfile ruvltra-routing-f16.gguf
./llama.cpp/llama-quantize ruvltra-routing-f16.gguf ruvltra-routing-q4_k_m.gguf Q4_K_M
```

#### Contrastive Embedding Training

**Using RuvLLM CLI (recommended):**
```bash
# Full contrastive training pipeline with triplet loss
npx @ruvector/ruvllm train contrastive --output ./training-output

# Exports: triplets.jsonl, embeddings.json, lora_config.json, train.sh
```

**Using Python (for GPU training):**
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, losses, InputExample
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

#### Rust Training Module

For production-scale dataset generation, use the Rust training module ([full docs](./crates/ruvllm/src/training/README.md)):

```rust
use ruvllm::training::{DatasetGenerator, DatasetConfig};

let config = DatasetConfig {
    examples_per_category: 100,
    enable_augmentation: true,
    seed: 42,
    ..Default::default()
};

let dataset = DatasetGenerator::new(config).generate();
let (train, val, test) = dataset.split(0.7, 0.15, 0.15, 42);
dataset.export_jsonl("training.jsonl")?;
```

**Features:**
- **5 agent categories**: Coder, Researcher, Security, Architecture, Reviewer (20% each)
- **Model routing**: Haiku (simple) → Sonnet (moderate) → Opus (complex/security)
- **Data augmentation**: Paraphrasing, complexity variations, domain transfer
- **8 technical domains**: Web, Systems, DataScience, Mobile, DevOps, Security, Database, API
- **Quality scores**: 0.80-0.96 based on template quality and category
- **Performance**: ~10,000 examples/second, ~50 MB/s JSONL export

```bash
cargo run --example generate_claude_dataset --release
# Outputs: train.jsonl, val.jsonl, test.jsonl, stats.json
```
