## About the book
The availability of foundation models has transformed AI from a specialized discipline into a powerful development tool everyone can use. This book covers the end-to-end process of adapting foundation models to solve real-world problems, encompassing tried-and-true techniques from other engineering fields and techniques emerging with foundation models.

_This is NOT a tutorial book, so it doesn't have a lot of code snippets._

## What this book is about
This book provides a framework for adapting foundation models, which include both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs), to specific applications. It not only outlines various solutions for building an AI application but also raises questions you can ask to evaluate the best solution for your needs. Here are just some of the many questions that this book can help you answer:

1. Should I build this AI application?
1. How do I evaluate my application? Can I use AI to evaluate AI outputs?
1. What causes hallucinations? How do I detect and mitigate hallucinations?
1. What are the best practices for prompt engineering?
1. Why does RAG work? What are the strategies for doing RAG?
1. What’s an agent? How do I build and evaluate an agent?
1. When to finetune a model? When not to finetune a model?
1. How much data do I need? How do I validate the quality of my data?
1. How do I make my model faster, cheaper, and secure?
1. How do I create a feedback loop to improve my application continually?

The book will also help you navigate the overwhelming AI landscape: types of models, evaluation benchmarks, and a seemingly infinite number of use cases and application patterns.

The content in this book is illustrated using actual case studies, many of which I’ve worked on, backed by ample references and extensively reviewed by experts from a wide range of backgrounds. Even though the book took two years to write, it draws from my experience working with language models and ML systems from the last decade.

Like my previous book, _[Designing Machine Learning Systems (DMLS)](https://amzn.to/4fXVZH2)_, this book focuses on the fundamentals of AI engineering instead of any specific tool or API. Tools become outdated quickly, but fundamentals should last longer.

### Reading _AI Engineering_ (AIE) with _Designing Machine Learning Systems_ (DMLS)
AIE can be a companion to DMLS. DMLS focuses on building applications on top of traditional ML models, which involves more tabular data annotations, feature engineering, and model training. AIE focuses on building applications on top of foundation models, which involves more prompt engineering, context construction, and parameter-efficient finetuning. Both books are self-contained and modular, so you can read either book independently.

Since foundation models are ML models, some concepts are relevant to working with both. If a topic is relevant to AIE but has been discussed extensively in DMLS, it’ll still be covered in this book, but to a lesser extent, with pointers to relevant resources. 

Note that many topics are covered in DMLS but not in AIE, and vice versa. The first chapter of this book also covers the differences between traditional ML engineering and AI engineering.

A real-world system often involves both traditional ML models and foundation models, so knowledge about working with both is often necessary.

## Who this book is for

This book is for anyone who wants to leverage foundation models to solve real-world problems. This is a technical book, so the language of this book is geared towards technical roles, including AI engineers, ML engineers, data scientists, engineering managers, and technical product managers. This book is for you if you can relate to one of the following scenarios:
* You’re building or optimizing an AI application, whether you’re starting from scratch or looking to move beyond the demo phase into a production-ready stage. You may also be facing issues like hallucinations, security, latency, or costs, and need targeted solutions.
* You want to streamline your team’s AI development process, making it more systematic, faster, and reliable.
* You want to understand how your organization can leverage foundation models to improve the business’s bottom line and how to build a team to do so.

You can also benefit from the book if you belong to one of the following groups:
* Tool developers who want to identify underserved areas in AI engineering to position your products in the ecosystem.
* Researchers who want to understand better AI use cases.
* Job candidates seeking clarity on the skills needed to pursue a career as an AI engineer.
* Anyone wanting to better understand AI's capabilities and limitations, and how it might affect different roles.

I love getting to the bottom of things, so some sections dive a bit deeper into the technical side. While many early readers like the detail, I know it might not be for everyone. I’ll give you a heads-up before things get too technical. Feel free to skip ahead if it feels a little too in the weeds!
