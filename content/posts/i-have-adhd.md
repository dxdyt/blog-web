## Install

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ayghri/i-have-adhd
claude plugin install i-have-adhd@i-have-adhd
```

Then type `/i-have-adhd`. No local clone needed: Claude Code fetches the repo and keeps it updated.

Want it on every session? `touch ~/.claude/.i-have-adhd-always` (see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)).

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex</strong></summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ayghri/i-have-adhd --ref main
codex plugin add i-have-adhd@i-have-adhd
```

Then type `$i-have-adhd` to apply the output style explicitly. The skill can also be invoked implicitly when Codex sees a task that benefits from it.

## What it does

A skill for your coding assistant that stops it from burying the answer. Action first. Steps numbered. No "Hope this helps!"


## What changes

## Before

> Great question! Let me think about this. Your auth flow has a few moving pieces: the middleware, the token verification, and the cookie handling. Looking at `src/auth.ts`, the `verifyToken` function (around lines 42-58) seems to be using an older `jsonwebtoken` API. One approach would be to update the package and rewrite that function. After making the change, you'd want to run the auth tests to confirm nothing breaks. By the way, you might also want to look at your dependency versions overall. Hope this helps! Let me know if you want to dig deeper.

<td width="50%">

## After

> Run `npm install jsonwebtoken@latest`, then edit `src/auth.ts:42`.
>
> 1. Open `src/auth.ts`
> 2. Replace `verifyToken` (lines 42–58) with the snippet below
> 3. Run `npm test -- auth.spec.ts`
>
> Next: paste the first failing line if any test fails.

## The rules

10 rules. Full text in [SKILL.md](./skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md).

1. Lead with the next action.
2. Number multi-step tasks.
3. End with one concrete next step.
4. Suppress tangents.
5. Restate state every turn.
6. Specific time estimates (minutes, not "a bit").
7. Make wins visible.
8. Matter-of-fact errors.
9. Cap lists at 5 items.
10. No preamble. No recap. No closers.

## Tune it

Fork, edit `skills/i-have-adhd/SKILL.md`, then swap your copy in:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall i-have-adhd            # drop the upstream copy first:
claude plugin marketplace remove i-have-adhd   # fork and upstream share both names
claude plugin marketplace add <your-username>/i-have-adhd
claude plugin install i-have-adhd@i-have-adhd
```

Restart Claude Code, then re-invoke `/i-have-adhd`.
