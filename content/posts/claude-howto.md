## The Problem

You installed Claude Code. You ran a few prompts. Now what?

- **The official docs describe features — but don't show you how to combine them.** You know slash commands exist, but not how to chain them with hooks, memory, and subagents into a workflow that actually saves hours.
- **There's no clear learning path.** Should you learn MCP before hooks? Skills before subagents? You end up skimming everything and mastering nothing.
- **Examples are too basic.** A "hello world" slash command doesn't help you build a production code review pipeline that uses memory, delegates to specialized agents, and runs security scans automatically.

You're leaving 90% of Claude Code's power on the table — and you don't know what you don't know.

---

## How Claude How To Fixes This

This isn't another feature reference. It's a **structured, visual, example-driven guide** that teaches you to use every Claude Code feature with real-world templates you can copy into your project today.

| | Official Docs | This Guide |
|--|---------------|------------|
| **Format** | Reference documentation | Visual tutorials with Mermaid diagrams |
| **Depth** | Feature descriptions | How it works under the hood |
| **Examples** | Basic snippets | Production-ready templates you use immediately |
| **Structure** | Feature-organized | Progressive learning path (beginner to advanced) |
| **Onboarding** | Self-directed | Guided roadmap with time estimates |
| **Self-Assessment** | None | Interactive quizzes to find your gaps and build a personalized path |

### What you get:

- **10 tutorial modules** covering every Claude Code feature — from slash commands to custom agent teams
- **Copy-paste configs** — slash commands, CLAUDE.md templates, hook scripts, MCP configs, subagent definitions, and full plugin bundles
- **Mermaid diagrams** showing how each feature works internally, so you understand *why*, not just *how*
- **A guided learning path** that takes you from beginner to power user in 11-13 hours
- **Built-in self-assessment** — run `/self-assessment` or `/lesson-quiz hooks` directly in Claude Code to identify gaps

**[Start the Learning Path  ->](LEARNING-ROADMAP.md)**

---

## How It Works

### 1. Find your level

Take the [self-assessment quiz](LEARNING-ROADMAP.md#-find-your-level) or run `/self-assessment` in Claude Code. Get a personalized roadmap based on what you already know.

### 2. Follow the guided path

Work through 10 modules in order — each builds on the last. Copy templates directly into your project as you learn.

### 3. Combine features into workflows

The real power is in combining features. Learn to wire slash commands + memory + subagents + hooks into automated pipelines that handle code reviews, deployments, and documentation generation.

### 4. Test your understanding

Run `/lesson-quiz [topic]` after each module. The quiz pinpoints what you missed so you can fill gaps fast.

## FAQ

**Is this free?**
Yes. MIT licensed, free forever. Use it in personal projects, at work, in your team — no restrictions beyond including the license notice.

**Is this maintained?**
Actively. The guide is synced with every Claude Code release. Current version: v2.2.0 (March 2026), compatible with Claude Code 2.1+.

**How is this different from the official docs?**
The official docs are a feature reference. This guide is a tutorial with diagrams, production-ready templates, and a progressive learning path. They complement each other — start here to learn, reference the docs when you need specifics.

**How long does it take to go through everything?**
11-13 hours for the full path. But you'll get immediate value in 15 minutes — just copy a slash command template and try it.

**Can I use this with Claude Sonnet / Haiku / Opus?**
Yes. All templates work with Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6, and Claude Haiku 4.5.

**Can I contribute?**
Absolutely. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines. We welcome new examples, bug fixes, documentation improvements, and community templates.

**Can I read this offline?**
Yes. Run `uv run scripts/build_epub.py` to generate an EPUB ebook with all content and rendered diagrams.

<summary>Best Practices</summary>

### Do's
- Start simple with slash commands
- Add features incrementally
- Use memory for team standards
- Test configurations locally first
- Document custom implementations
- Version control project configurations
- Share plugins with team

### Don'ts
- Don't create redundant features
- Don't hardcode credentials
- Don't skip documentation
- Don't over-complicate simple tasks
- Don't ignore security best practices
- Don't commit sensitive data

</details>

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

### Feature Not Loading
1. Check file location and naming
2. Verify YAML frontmatter syntax
3. Check file permissions
4. Review Claude Code version compatibility

### MCP Connection Failed
1. Verify environment variables
2. Check MCP server installation
3. Test credentials
4. Review network connectivity

### Subagent Not Delegating
1. Check tool permissions
2. Verify agent description clarity
3. Review task complexity
4. Test agent independently
