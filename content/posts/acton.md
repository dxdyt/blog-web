# Acton

<img align="right" src="docs/public/logo.png" height="150px" alt="Acton logo" />

Acton is an all-in-one TON smart contract development toolkit written in Rust.
It combines project scaffolding, build, testing, scripting, wallet and network
operations, verification, linting, formatting, debugging, and low-level VM
tooling in one CLI.

Documentation: https://ton-blockchain.github.io/acton/docs/welcome

<br clear="right" />

## Why Acton

- Single CLI for the full contract lifecycle: create, build, test, debug,
  deploy, verify.
- Native speed (Rust-based toolchain and test runtime).
- Tolk-first workflow with built-in wrappers, testing utilities, and scripts.
- Ready for dApp development with project templates and automatically generated TypeScript wrappers.
- Fast test runner with fork mode, gas snapshots, coverage, mutation, fuzzing testing and nice UI.
- Browser test UI for failed tests, traces, logs, and coverage inspection.

## Install

The recommended way to get Acton today is to run the latest public installer:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/ton-blockchain/acton/releases/latest/download/acton-installer.sh | sh
```

If you prefer a manual download, use the latest public release:

| Platform | Architecture | Download                                                                                                                                          |

| Linux    | x86_64       | [acton-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/acton/releases/latest/download/acton-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz)   |

After extracting the archive, make sure `acton` is on your `PATH` and verify
the installation:

```bash
acton --version
```

If you prefer a containerized workflow, use the published Docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/ton-blockchain/acton:<version> --version
```

To run Acton against the current project from Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace \
  ghcr.io/ton-blockchain/acton:<version> \
  build
```

For more installation details, see the
[installation guide](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/acton/docs/installation).

## Support policy

Acton is stable on the latest numbered GitHub release. The first-class platform
matrix is macOS (ARM64, x86_64) plus Linux GNU (x86_64, ARM64). For Linux, the
documented baseline is Ubuntu 20.04 or newer. Native Windows is not supported
today. If you use Windows, run Acton inside WSL with Ubuntu 20.04 or newer and
follow the Linux installation path there. `trunk` builds installed via
`acton up --trunk`, WSL installs, and other source-built targets are beta /
best-effort surfaces for now. The full policy is documented at
[Support policy](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/acton/docs/installation#support-policy).

## From zero to testnet

```bash
# Create a new project from the built-in counter template
acton new first_counter --template counter
cd first_counter

# Build and test locally
acton build
acton test

# Create and fund a local testnet wallet
acton wallet new --name deployer --local --airdrop --version v5r1

# Deploy to TON testnet
acton script scripts/deploy.tolk --net testnet
```

For a step-by-step walkthrough, see the
[quickstart guide](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/acton/docs/quickstart).

Already have a repository instead of starting from a template? The existing
project path is:

```bash
cd your-repo
acton init
acton build
acton test
```
