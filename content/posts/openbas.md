## Introduction

OpenBAS is an open source platform allowing organizations to plan, schedule and conduct cyber adversary simulation
campaign and tests.

## Objective

The goal is to create a powerful, reliable and open source tool to effectively plan and play all types of simulations,
training and exercises from the technical level to the strategic one. Also, the platform is able to give you a proper
overview of any security gaps regarding actual threats with knowledge coming from
the [OpenCTI platform](https://opencti.io).

OpenBAS aims to respond to these issues, which not only concern state services but also many private organizations. With
different modules (scenarios, teams, simulations, verification of means of communication, encryption, etc.), the
platform offers advantages such as collaborative work, real-time monitoring, statistics or the management of feedback.

Finally, OpenBAS supports different types of inject, allowing the tool to be integrated with emails, SMS platforms,
social medias, alarm systems, etc. All currently supported integration can be found in
the [OpenBAS ecosystem](https://docs.openbas.io/latest/development/injectors/).

## Editions of the platform

OpenBAS platform has 2 different editions: Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE). The purpose of the Enterprise Edition is
to provide [additional and powerful features](https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe) which require specific investments
in research and development. You can enable the Enterprise Edition directly in the settings of the platform.

* OpenBAS Community Edition, licensed under the [Apache 2, Version 2.0 license](LICENSE).
* OpenBAS Enterprise Edition, licensed under the [Enterprise Edition license](LICENSE).

To understand what OpenBAS Enterprise Edition brings in terms of features, just check
the [Enterprise Editions page](https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe) on the Filigran website. You can also try this
edition by enabling it in the settings of the platform.
