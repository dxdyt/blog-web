## Quickstart: Add Skills to Codex

### Install with the Skill Installer (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-codex-skills.git
cd awesome-codex-skills
# Install one or more skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills (defaults to ~/.codex/skills)
python skill-installer/scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo ComposioHQ/awesome-codex-skills --path meeting-notes-and-actions
```

The installer fetches the skill and places it in `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>`. Restart Codex to pick up new skills.

### Manual install

1. Copy the desired skill folder (e.g., `./spreadsheet-formula-helper`) into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills/`).
2. Restart Codex so it loads the new metadata.
3. In your next session, describe the task or mention the skill name; Codex will trigger matching skills based on their `description` frontmatter.

## What Are Codex Skills?

Codex skills are modular instruction bundles that tell Codex how to execute a task the way you want it done. Each skill lives in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` that includes metadata (name + description) and step-by-step guidance. Codex reads the metadata to decide when to trigger a skill and loads the body only after it fires, keeping context lean.

## Using Skills in Codex

- Skills live in `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default `~/.codex/skills`). Each subfolder needs a `SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter.
- After installing or updating a skill, restart Codex so it reloads metadata.
- In a session, describe the task naturally; Codex auto-triggers skills whose descriptions match the request. You can also mention a skill by name if you want it considered.
- To verify installation, list installed skills (`ls ~/.codex/skills`) and inspect metadata (`head ~/.codex/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`).

## Creating Skills

Skill layout:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + YAML frontmatter
├── scripts/          # Optional: helper scripts for deterministic steps
├── references/       # Optional: long-form docs loaded only when needed
└── assets/           # Optional: templates or files used in outputs
```

Basic SKILL.md template:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: What the skill does and when Codex should use it.
---

# My Skill Name

Clear instructions and steps for Codex to execute the task.
```

Best practices:

- Keep the `description` exhaustive about when to trigger; keep the body focused on execution steps.
- Use progressive disclosure: put detailed references in `references/` and call them out from `SKILL.md` only when needed.
- Include scripts for repeatable or deterministic operations; mention when Codex should run them.
- Avoid extra docs (README, changelog) inside the skill folder to keep context lean.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Add real, reusable skills, keep descriptions precise, and include any needed scripts or references. If you add new skills, ensure the `description` clearly states when Codex should trigger and test that metadata fits within context limits.
