# Introduction

LTX-Video is the first DiT-based video generation model that can generate high-quality videos in *real-time*.
It can generate 30 FPS videos at 1216×704 resolution, faster than it takes to watch them.
The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of diverse videos and can generate high-resolution videos
with realistic and diverse content.

The model supports text-to-image, image-to-video, keyframe-based animation, video extension (both forward and backward), video-to-video transformations, and any combination of these features.

The woman with brown hair wears a black jacket and has a small, barely noticeable mole on her right cheek. The camera angle is a close-up, focused on the woman with brown hair's face. The lighting is warm and natural, likely from the setting sun, casting a soft glow on the scene.

The peaks are jagged and irregular, with some rising sharply into the sky while others are more rounded. The valleys are deep and narrow, with steep slopes that are also covered in snow. The trees in the foreground are mostly bare, with only a few leaves remaining on their branches. The sky is overcast, with thick clouds obscuring the sun. The overall impression is one of peace and tranquility, with the snow-covered mountains standing as a testament to the power and beauty of nature.</details> |

# Quick Start Guide

## Online inference
The model is accessible right away via the following links:
- [LTX-Studio image-to-video](https://app.ltx.studio/ltx-video)
- [Fal.ai text-to-video](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/ltx-video)
- [Fal.ai image-to-video](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/ltx-video/image-to-video)
- [Replicate text-to-video and image-to-video](https://replicate.com/lightricks/ltx-video)

## Run locally

### Installation
The codebase was tested with Python 3.10.5, CUDA version 12.2, and supports PyTorch >= 2.1.2.
On macos, MPS was tested with PyTorch 2.3.0, and should support PyTorch == 2.3 or >= 2.6.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video.git
cd LTX-Video

# create env
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .\[inference-script\]
```

### Inference

📝 **Note:** For best results, we recommend using our [ComfyUI](#comfyui-integration) workflow. We’re working on updating the inference.py script to match the high quality and output fidelity of ComfyUI.

To use our model, please follow the inference code in [inference.py](./inference.py):

#### For text-to-video generation:

```bash
python inference.py --prompt "PROMPT" --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH --num_frames NUM_FRAMES --seed SEED --pipeline_config configs/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-dev.yaml
```

#### For image-to-video generation:

```bash
python inference.py --prompt "PROMPT" --conditioning_media_paths IMAGE_PATH --conditioning_start_frames 0 --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH --num_frames NUM_FRAMES --seed SEED --pipeline_config configs/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-dev.yaml
```

#### Extending a video:

📝 **Note:** Input video segments must contain a multiple of 8 frames plus 1 (e.g., 9, 17, 25, etc.), and the target frame number should be a multiple of 8.


```bash
python inference.py --prompt "PROMPT" --conditioning_media_paths VIDEO_PATH --conditioning_start_frames START_FRAME --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH --num_frames NUM_FRAMES --seed SEED --pipeline_config configs/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-dev.yaml
```

#### For video generation with multiple conditions:

You can now generate a video conditioned on a set of images and/or short video segments.
Simply provide a list of paths to the images or video segments you want to condition on, along with their target frame numbers in the generated video. You can also specify the conditioning strength for each item (default: 1.0).

```bash
python inference.py --prompt "PROMPT" --conditioning_media_paths IMAGE_OR_VIDEO_PATH_1 IMAGE_OR_VIDEO_PATH_2 --conditioning_start_frames TARGET_FRAME_1 TARGET_FRAME_2 --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH --num_frames NUM_FRAMES --seed SEED --pipeline_config configs/ltxv-13b-0.9.7-dev.yaml
```

## ComfyUI Integration
To use our model with ComfyUI, please follow the instructions at [https://github.com/Lightricks/ComfyUI-LTXVideo/](https://github.com/Lightricks/ComfyUI-LTXVideo/).

## Diffusers Integration
To use our model with the Diffusers Python library, check out the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/ltx_video).

Diffusers also support an 8-bit version of LTX-Video, [see details below](#ltx-videoq8)

# Model User Guide

## 📝 Prompt Engineering

When writing prompts, focus on detailed, chronological descriptions of actions and scenes. Include specific movements, appearances, camera angles, and environmental details - all in a single flowing paragraph. Start directly with the action, and keep descriptions literal and precise. Think like a cinematographer describing a shot list. Keep within 200 words. For best results, build your prompts using this structure:

* Start with main action in a single sentence
* Add specific details about movements and gestures
* Describe character/object appearances precisely
* Include background and environment details
* Specify camera angles and movements
* Describe lighting and colors
* Note any changes or sudden events
* See [examples](#introduction) for more inspiration.

### Automatic Prompt Enhancement
When using `inference.py`, shorts prompts (below `prompt_enhancement_words_threshold` words) are automatically enhanced by a language model. This is supported with text-to-video and image-to-video (first-frame conditioning).

When using `LTXVideoPipeline` directly, you can enable prompt enhancement by setting `enhance_prompt=True`.

## 🎮 Parameter Guide

* Resolution Preset: Higher resolutions for detailed scenes, lower for faster generation and simpler scenes. The model works on resolutions that are divisible by 32 and number of frames that are divisible by 8 + 1 (e.g. 257). In case the resolution or number of frames are not divisible by 32 or 8 + 1, the input will be padded with -1 and then cropped to the desired resolution and number of frames. The model works best on resolutions under 720 x 1280 and number of frames below 257
* Seed: Save seed values to recreate specific styles or compositions you like
* Guidance Scale: 3-3.5 are the recommended values
* Inference Steps: More steps (40+) for quality, fewer steps (20-30) for speed

📝 For advanced parameters usage, please see `python inference.py --help`

- **Repository:** [LTX-VideoQ8](https://github.com/KONAKONA666/LTX-Video)
- **Features:**
  - 🚀 Up to 3X speed-up with no accuracy loss
  - 🎥 Generate 720x480x121 videos in under a minute on RTX 4060 (8GB VRAM)
  - 🛠️ Fine-tune 2B transformer models with precalculated latents
- **Community Discussion:** [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1h79ks2/fast_ltx_video_on_rtx_4060_and_other_ada_gpus/)
- **Diffusers integration:** A diffusers integration for the 8-bit model is already out! [Details here](https://github.com/sayakpaul/q8-ltx-video)


### TeaCache for LTX-Video 🍵 <a id="TeaCache"></a>

**TeaCache** is a training-free caching approach that leverages timestep differences across model outputs to accelerate LTX-Video inference by up to 2x without significant visual quality degradation.

- **Repository:** [TeaCache4LTX-Video](https://github.com/ali-vilab/TeaCache/tree/main/TeaCache4LTX-Video)
- **Features:**
  - 🚀 Speeds up LTX-Video inference.
  - 📊 Adjustable trade-offs between speed (up to 2x) and visual quality using configurable parameters.
  - 🛠️ No retraining required: Works directly with existing models.

# Training

## Diffusers

Diffusers implemented [LoRA support](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/10228),
with a training script for fine-tuning.
More information and training script in
[finetrainers](https://github.com/a-r-r-o-w/finetrainers?tab=readme-ov-file#training).

## Diffusion-Pipe

An experimental training framework with pipeline parallelism, enabling fine-tuning of large models like **LTX-Video** across multiple GPUs.

- **Repository:** [Diffusion-Pipe](https://github.com/tdrussell/diffusion-pipe)
- **Features:**
  - 🛠️ Full fine-tune support for LTX-Video using LoRA
  - 📊 Useful metrics logged to Tensorboard
  - 🔄 Training state checkpointing and resumption
  - ⚡ Efficient pre-caching of latents and text embeddings for multi-GPU setups
