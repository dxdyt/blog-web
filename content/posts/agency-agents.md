## ⚡ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use with Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
# Copy agents to your Claude Code directory
cp -r agency-agents/* ~/.claude/agents/

# "Hey Claude, activate Frontend Developer mode and help me build a React component"
```

### Option 2: Use as Reference

Each agent file contains:
- Identity & personality traits
- Core mission & workflows
- Technical deliverables with code examples
- Success metrics & communication style

Browse the agents below and copy/adapt the ones you need!

### Option 3: Use with Other Tools (Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, OpenCode)

```bash
# Step 1 -- generate integration files for all supported tools
./scripts/convert.sh

# Step 2 -- install interactively (auto-detects what you have installed)
./scripts/install.sh

# Or target a specific tool directly
./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
./scripts/install.sh --tool copilot
./scripts/install.sh --tool aider
./scripts/install.sh --tool windsurf

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

Each agent becomes a `.mdc` rule file in `.cursor/rules/` of your project.

```bash
cd /your/project
/path/to/agency-agents/scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
```

Rules are auto-applied when Cursor detects them in the project. Reference them explicitly:
```
Use the @security-engineer rules to review this code.
```

See [integrations/cursor/README.md](integrations/cursor/README.md) for details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Aider</strong></summary>

All agents are compiled into a single `CONVENTIONS.md` file that Aider reads automatically.

```bash
cd /your/project
/path/to/agency-agents/scripts/install.sh --tool aider
```

Then reference agents in your Aider session:
```
Use the Frontend Developer agent to refactor this component.
```

See [integrations/aider/README.md](integrations/aider/README.md) for details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windsurf</strong></summary>

All agents are compiled into `.windsurfrules` in your project root.

```bash
cd /your/project
/path/to/agency-agents/scripts/install.sh --tool windsurf
```

Reference agents in Windsurf's Cascade:
```
Use the Reality Checker agent to verify this is production ready.
```

See [integrations/windsurf/README.md](integrations/windsurf/README.md) for details.

### Regenerating After Changes

When you add new agents or edit existing ones, regenerate all integration files:

```bash
./scripts/convert.sh        # regenerate all
./scripts/convert.sh --tool cursor   # regenerate just one tool
```
