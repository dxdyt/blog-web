## Overview

The Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) addresses a fragmented commerce landscape
by providing a standardized common language and functional primitives. It
enables platforms (like AI agents and apps), businesses, Payment Service
Providers (PSPs), and Credential Providers (CPs) to communicate effectively,
ensuring secure and consistent commerce experiences across the web.

With UCP, businesses can:

* **Declare** supported capabilities to enable autonomous discovery by
    platforms.
* **Facilitate** secure checkout sessions, with or without human intervention.
* **Offer** personalized shopping experiences through standardized data
    exchange.

## Why UCP?

As commerce becomes increasingly agentic and distributed, the ability for
different systems to interoperate without custom, one-off integrations is vital.
UCP aims to:

* **Standardize Interaction:** Provide a uniform way for platforms to interact
    with businesses, regardless of the underlying backend.
* **Modularize Commerce:** Breakdown commerce into distinct **Capabilities**
    (e.g., Checkout, Order) and **Extensions** (e.g., Discounts,
    Fulfillment), allowing for flexible implementation.
* **Enable Agentic Commerce:** Designed from the ground up to support AI
    agents acting on behalf of users to discover products, fill carts, and
    complete purchases securely.
* **Enhance Security:** Support for advanced security patterns like AP2
    mandates and verifiable credentials.

### Key Features

* **Composable Architecture:** UCP defines **Capabilities** (such as
    "Checkout" or "Identity Linking") that businesses implement to enable easy
    integration. On top of that, specific **Extensions** can be added to enhance
    the consumer experience without bloating the capability definitions.
* **Dynamic Discovery:** Businesses declare their supported Capabilities in a
    standardized profile, allowing platforms to autonomously discover and
    configure themselves.
* **Transport Agnostic:** The protocol is designed to work across various
    transports. Businesses can offer Capabilities via REST APIs, MCP (Model
    Context Protocol), or A2A, depending on their infrastructure.
* **Built on Standards:** UCP leverages existing open standards for payments,
    identity, and security wherever applicable, rather than reinventing the
    wheel.
* **Developer Friendly:** A comprehensive set of SDKs and libraries
    facilitates rapid development and integration.

## Key Capabilities

The initial release focuses on the essential primitives for transacting:

* **Checkout:** Facilitates checkout sessions including cart management and
    tax calculation, supporting flows with or without human intervention.
* **Identity Linking:** Enables platforms to obtain authorization to perform
    actions on a user's behalf via OAuth 2.0.
* **Order:** Webhook-based updates for order lifecycle events (shipped,
    delivered, returned).
* **Payment Token Exchange:** Protocols for PSPs and Credential Providers to
    securely exchange payment tokens and credentials.
