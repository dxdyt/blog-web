# ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment
Welcome to the repo behind my 6-month live trading experiment where ChatGPT manages a real-money micro-cap portfolio.

## Overview on getting started: [Here](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment/blob/main/Start%20Your%20Own/README.md)
   
## Repository Structure

- **`trading_script.py`** - Main trading engine with portfolio management and stop-loss automation
- **`Scripts and CSV Files/`** - My personal portfolio (updates every trading day)
- **`Start Your Own/`** - Template files and guide for starting your own experiment  
- **`Weekly Deep Research (MD|PDF)/`** - Research summaries and performance reports
- **`Experiment Details/`** - Documentation, methodology, prompts, and Q&A

# The Concept
Every day, I kept seeing the same ad about having some A.I. pick undervalued stocks. It was obvious it was trying to get me to subscribe to some garbage, so I just rolled my eyes.  
Then I started wondering, "How well would that actually work?"

So, starting with just $100, I wanted to answer a simple but powerful question:

**Can powerful large language models like ChatGPT actually generate alpha (or at least make smart trading decisions) using real-time data?**

## Each trading day:

- I provide it trading data on the stocks in its portfolio.  
- Strict stop-loss rules apply.  
- Every week I allow it to use deep research to reevaluate its account.  
- I track and publish performance data weekly on my blog: [Here](https://nathanbsmith729.substack.com)
