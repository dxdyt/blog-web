## Strix Overview

Strix are autonomous AI penetration testing agents that act just like real hackers - they run your code dynamically, find vulnerabilities, and validate them through actual proofs-of-concept. Built for developers and security teams who need fast, accurate security testing without the overhead of manual pentesting or the false positives of static analysis tools.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Full pentesting toolkit** - reconnaissance, exploitation, and validation out of the box
- **Multi-agent orchestration** - teams of AI pentesters that collaborate and scale
- **Real exploit validation** - working PoCs, not false positives like legacy vulnerability scanners
- **Developer‑first CLI** - actionable findings with remediation guidance
- **Auto‑fix & reporting** - generate patches and compliance-ready pentest reports

## Use Cases

- **Application Security Testing** - Detect and validate critical vulnerabilities in your applications
- **Rapid Penetration Testing** - Get penetration tests done in hours, not weeks, with compliance reports
- **Bug Bounty Automation** - Automate bug bounty research and generate PoCs for faster reporting
- **CI/CD Integration** - Run tests in CI/CD to block vulnerabilities before reaching production

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker (running)
- An LLM API key from any [supported provider](https://docs.strix.ai/llm-providers/overview) (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)

### Installation & First Scan

```bash
# Install Strix
curl -sSL https://strix.ai/install | bash

# Configure your AI provider
export STRIX_LLM="openai/gpt-5.4"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run your first security assessment
strix --target ./app-directory
```

> [!NOTE]
> First run automatically pulls the sandbox Docker image. Results are saved to `strix_runs/<run-name>`

## ✨ Features

### Agentic Pentesting Tools

Strix agents come equipped with a comprehensive offensive security toolkit - the same tools used by professional penetration testers and ethical hackers:

- **HTTP Interception Proxy** - Full request/response manipulation and analysis with Caido
- **Browser Exploitation** - Automated browser for testing XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, and auth bypass flows
- **Shell & Command Execution** - Interactive terminal for exploit development and post-exploitation
- **Custom Exploit Runtime** - Python sandbox for writing and validating proof-of-concept exploits
- **Reconnaissance & OSINT** - Automated attack surface mapping, subdomain enumeration, and fingerprinting
- **Static & Dynamic Code Analysis** - SAST + DAST capabilities for comprehensive application security testing
- **Vulnerability Knowledge Base** - Structured findings with CVSS scoring and OWASP classification

### Comprehensive Vulnerability Scanner

Strix identifies, validates, and exploits a wide range of security vulnerabilities across the OWASP Top 10 and beyond:

- **Broken Access Control** - IDOR, privilege escalation, auth bypass
- **Injection Attacks** - SQL injection, NoSQL injection, OS command injection, SSTI
- **Server-Side Vulnerabilities** - SSRF, XXE, insecure deserialization, RCE
- **Client-Side Attacks** - XSS (stored/reflected/DOM), prototype pollution, CSRF
- **Business Logic Flaws** - Race conditions, payment manipulation, workflow bypass
- **Authentication & Session** - JWT attacks, session fixation, credential stuffing vectors
- **Infrastructure & Cloud** - Misconfigurations, exposed services, cloud security issues
- **API Security** - Broken authentication, mass assignment, rate limiting bypass

### Graph of Agents (Multi-Agent Pentesting)

Advanced multi-agent orchestration for comprehensive automated penetration testing:

- **Distributed Pentesting** - Specialized AI agents for recon, exploitation, and post-exploitation
- **Scalable Security Testing** - Parallel execution across multiple targets for fast, comprehensive coverage
- **Dynamic Coordination** - Agents share discoveries, chain vulnerabilities, and collaborate like a red team

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan a local codebase
strix --target ./app-directory

# Security review of a GitHub repository
strix --target https://github.com/org/repo

# Black-box web application assessment
strix --target https://your-app.com
```

### Advanced Testing Scenarios

```bash
# Grey-box authenticated testing
strix --target https://your-app.com --instruction "Perform authenticated testing using credentials: user:pass"

# Multi-target testing (source code + deployed app)
strix -t https://github.com/org/app -t https://your-app.com

# White-box source-aware scan (local repository)
strix --target ./app-directory --scan-mode standard

# Focused testing with custom instructions
strix --target api.your-app.com --instruction "Focus on business logic flaws and IDOR vulnerabilities"

# Provide detailed instructions through file (e.g., rules of engagement, scope, exclusions)
strix --target api.your-app.com --instruction-file ./instruction.md

# Force PR diff-scope against a specific base branch
strix -n --target ./ --scan-mode quick --scope-mode diff --diff-base origin/main
```

### Headless Mode

Run Strix programmatically without interactive UI using the `-n/--non-interactive` flag - perfect for servers and automated jobs. The CLI prints real-time vulnerability findings and the final report before exiting. Exits with non-zero code when vulnerabilities are found.

```bash
strix -n --target https://your-app.com
```

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Strix can be added to your pipeline to run a security test on pull requests with a lightweight GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: strix-penetration-test

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install Strix
        run: curl -sSL https://strix.ai/install | bash

      - name: Run Strix
        env:
          STRIX_LLM: ${{ secrets.STRIX_LLM }}
          LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}

        run: strix -n -t ./ --scan-mode quick
```

> [!TIP]
> In CI pull request runs, Strix automatically scopes quick reviews to changed files.
> If diff-scope cannot resolve, ensure checkout uses full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) or pass
> `--diff-base` explicitly.

### Configuration

```bash
export STRIX_LLM="openai/gpt-5.4"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Optional
export LLM_API_BASE="your-api-base-url"  # if using a local model, e.g. Ollama, LMStudio
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # for search capabilities
export STRIX_REASONING_EFFORT="high"  # control thinking effort (default: high, quick scan: medium)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Strix automatically saves your configuration to `~/.strix/cli-config.json`, so you don't have to re-enter it on every run.
