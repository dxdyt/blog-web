# Stitch Design Skills

A collection of agent skills and plugins for [Google Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com), following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Compatible with coding agents such as Codex, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, Claude Code, and Cursor.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Plugins (Recommended)
The fastest way to set up the full Stitch plugin suite globally.

#### Codex

Add the Stitch Skills marketplace, then install the plugins you need.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Via CLI</strong> (recommended)</summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add google-labs-code/stitch-skills --ref main \
  --sparse .agents/plugins \
  --sparse plugins/stitch-design \
  --sparse plugins/stitch-build \
  --sparse plugins/stitch-utilities
```

> [!TIP]
> The `--sparse` flags are optional — they limit the checkout to only the
> listed paths for a faster clone. Omit them to pull the entire repository.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Via the Codex UI</strong></summary>

Navigate to **Settings → Plugin Marketplaces → Add** and fill in:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Source** | `https://github.com/google-labs-code/stitch-skills` |
| **Git ref** | `main` |
| **Sparse paths** | *(optional)* `.agents/plugins`, `plugins/stitch-design`, `plugins/stitch-build`, `plugins/stitch-utilities` |

</details>

Once the marketplace is registered, install any combination of:

- **`stitch-design`** — design-focused skills
- **`stitch-build`** — build and component skills
- **`stitch-utilities`** — utility and helper skills

#### Claude Code & Cursor

```bash
# Claude Code — installs into the current project
npx plugins add google-labs-code/stitch-skills --scope project --target claude-code
```

```bash
# Cursor — installs into the current workspace
npx plugins add google-labs-code/stitch-skills --scope workspace --target cursor
```

### 2. Install Skills Selectively
Choose only the specific skills you need.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Stitch Design Skills often have inter-dependencies. If you choose to install skills selectively, ensure you include all required dependencies.

```bash
npx skills add google-labs-code/stitch-skills
```

You can run the following commands to see the help documentation for plugins and skills:

```bash
npx plugins --help

npx skills --help
```

## Prerequisites

These skills require the **Stitch MCP** server to be configured and running in your agent's environment. Make sure you have followed the [Stitch MCP Setup Instructions](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/docs/mcp/setup/) to register the server and set up appropriate environment variables and credentials.
