## ⚠️ Disclaimer
> This tool is intended for educational and lawful investigative purposes only. Accessing or interacting with certain dark web content may be illegal depending on your jurisdiction. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this tool or the data gathered using it.
>
> Use responsibly and at your own risk. Ensure you comply with all relevant laws and institutional policies before conducting OSINT investigations.
>
> Additionally, Robin leverages third-party APIs (including LLMs). Be cautious when sending potentially sensitive queries, and review the terms of service for any API or model provider you use.

## Installation
> [!NOTE]
> The tool needs Tor to do the searches. You can install Tor using `apt install tor` on Linux/Windows(WSL) or `brew install tor` on Mac. Once installed, confirm if Tor is running in the background.

> [!TIP]
> You can provide OpenAI or Anthropic or Google API key by either creating .env file (refer to sample env file in the repo) or by setting env variables in PATH.
>
> For Ollama, provide `http://host.docker.internal:11434` as `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in your env if running using docker method or `http://127.0.0.1:11434` for other methods. You might need to serve Ollama on 0.0.0.0 depending on your OS. You can do by running `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve &` in your terminal.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model {gpt4o,gpt-4.1,claude-3-5-sonnet-latest,llama3.1,gemini-2.5-flash}, -m {gpt4o,gpt-4.1,claude-3-5-sonnet-latest,llama3.1,gemini-2.5-flash}
                        Select LLM model (e.g., gpt4o, claude sonnet 3.5, ollama models, gemini 2.5 flash)
  --query QUERY, -q QUERY
                        Dark web search query
  --threads THREADS, -t THREADS
                        Number of threads to use for scraping (Default: 5)
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Filename to save the final intelligence summary. If not provided, a filename based on the
                        current date and time is used.

Example commands:
 - robin -m gpt4.1 -q "ransomware payments" -t 12
 - robin --model gpt4.1 --query "sensitive credentials exposure" --threads 8 --output filename
