## 📚 Week 3: Keyword Search First - The Critical Foundation ⚡

> **🚨 The 90% Problem:** Most RAG systems jump straight to vector search and miss the foundation that powers the best retrieval systems. We're doing it right!

**Building on Weeks 1-2 foundation:** Implement the keyword search foundation that professional RAG systems rely on.

### **🎯 Why Keyword Search First?**

**The Reality Check:** Vector search alone is not enough. The most effective RAG systems use **hybrid retrieval** - combining keyword search (BM25) with vector search. Here's why we start with keywords:

1. **🔍 Exact Match Power:** Keywords excel at finding specific terms, technical jargon, and precise phrases
2. **📊 Interpretable Results:** You can understand exactly why a document was retrieved  
3. **⚡ Speed & Efficiency:** BM25 is computationally fast and doesn't require expensive embedding models
4. **🎯 Domain Knowledge:** Technical papers often require exact terminology matches that vector search might miss
5. **📈 Production Reality:** Companies like Elasticsearch, Algolia, and enterprise search all use keyword search as their foundation

### **🏗️ Week 3 Architecture Overview**

#### **💡 The Pedagogical Approach**
```
Week 3: Master keyword search (BM25) ← YOU ARE HERE
Week 4: Add intelligent chunking strategies  
Week 5: Introduce vector embeddings for hybrid retrieval
Week 6: Optimize the complete hybrid system
```

**This progression mirrors how successful companies build search systems - solid foundation first, then enhance with advanced techniques.**

### **📓 Week 3 Implementation Guide**

```bash
# Launch the Week 3 notebook
uv run jupyter notebook notebooks/week3/week3_opensearch.ipynb
```

### **💻 Code Examples**

**BM25 Search Implementation:**
```python
# Example: Search papers with BM25 scoring
from src.services.opensearch.factory import make_opensearch_client

async def search_papers():
    client = make_opensearch_client()
    results = await client.search_papers(
        query="transformer attention mechanism",
        max_results=10,
        categories=["cs.AI", "cs.LG"]
    )
    return results  # Papers ranked by BM25 relevance
```

**Search API Usage:**
```python

> **🎯 Production Excellence:** Transform your RAG system from functional to production-ready with comprehensive monitoring and intelligent caching.

**Building on Week 5 complete RAG system:** Add observability, performance optimization, and production-grade monitoring.

### **🎯 Why Monitoring + Caching?**

**The Production Reality:** A working RAG system isn't enough - you need visibility and optimization:

1. **📊 Complete Observability:** Trace every step from query to answer with Langfuse
2. **⚡ 150-400x Performance Boost:** Redis caching serves repeated queries in ~50ms vs 15-20s
3. **💰 Cost Optimization:** 60%+ cache hit rate eliminates redundant LLM calls
4. **🔍 Performance Insights:** Real-time dashboards showing bottlenecks and opportunities
5. **🛡️ Production Hardening:** Health checks, graceful degradation, and monitoring

### **🏗️ Week 6 Architecture Overview**

  <br>
  <em>Production RAG system with Langfuse tracing and Redis caching layers</em>
</p>

**Production Infrastructure:** Complete observability layer with Langfuse tracking every RAG operation, plus Redis caching for instant response delivery.

#### **🎯 Learning Objectives**
- **Langfuse Integration:** End-to-end RAG pipeline tracing with performance analytics
- **Redis Caching Strategy:** Intelligent cache keys with TTL management and fallback
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time dashboards showing latency, costs, and hit rates
- **Production Patterns:** Industry-standard observability and optimization techniques
- **Cost Analysis:** Understanding and optimizing LLM usage and infrastructure costs

#### **Key Components**
- `src/services/langfuse/`: Complete tracing integration with RAG-specific metrics
- `src/services/cache/`: Redis client with exact-match caching and graceful fallback
- `src/routers/ask.py`: Updated with integrated tracing and caching middleware
- `docker-compose.yml`: Added Redis service and Langfuse local instance
- `notebooks/week6/`: Complete monitoring and caching implementation guide

### **📓 Week 6 Implementation Guide**

```bash
# Launch the Week 6 notebook
uv run jupyter notebook notebooks/week6/week6_cache_testing.ipynb
```

### **💻 Code Examples**

**Langfuse Tracing Integration:**
```python
# Example: Automatic RAG tracing (already integrated)
# Every request to /api/v1/ask automatically generates:
# - Request-level traces for complete query journey
# - Embedding spans timing query embedding generation
# - Search spans tracking retrieval performance
# - Generation spans monitoring LLM response creation

# Simply configure environment variables and tracing happens automatically
LANGFUSE__PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-your-key
LANGFUSE__SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-your-key
LANGFUSE__HOST=http://localhost:3000
```

**Redis Caching Performance:**
```python
# Example: Cache performance testing
import httpx
import time

async def test_cache_performance():
    # First request (cache miss ~15-20s)
    start = time.time()
    response = await httpx.AsyncClient().post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ask", json={
        "query": "What are transformers in machine learning?",
        "top_k": 3
    })
    first_time = time.time() - start
    
    # Second identical request (cache hit ~50ms)
    start = time.time()
    response = await httpx.AsyncClient().post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ask", json={
        "query": "What are transformers in machine learning?",
        "top_k": 3
    })
    second_time = time.time() - start
    
    print(f"First request: {first_time:.2f}s")
    print(f"Second request: {second_time:.2f}s")
    print(f"Speedup: {first_time/second_time:.0f}x faster")
```
