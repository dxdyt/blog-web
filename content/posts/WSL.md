## About

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a powerful way for you to run your Linux command-line tools, utilities and applications, all unmodified and directly on Windows without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual boot setup.

You can install WSL right away by running this command inside of your Windows command line:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

You can learn more about [best practices for setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/setup/environment), [overviews of WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about) and more at our [WSL documentation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/).
