**OmniParser** is a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured and easy-to-understand elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. 

## News
- [2025/3] We support local logging of trajecotry so that you can use OmniParser+OmniTool to build training data pipeline for your favorate agent in your domain. [Documentation WIP]
- [2025/3] We are gradually adding multi agents orchstration and improving user interface in OmniTool for better experience.
- [2025/2] We release OmniParser V2 [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser-v2.0). [Watch Video](https://1drv.ms/v/c/650b027c18d5a573/EWXbVESKWo9Buu6OYCwg06wBeoM97C6EOTG6RjvWLEN1Qg?e=alnHGC)
- [2025/2] We introduce OmniTool: Control a Windows 11 VM with OmniParser + your vision model of choice. OmniTool supports out of the box the following large language models - OpenAI (4o/o1/o3-mini), DeepSeek (R1), Qwen (2.5VL) or Anthropic Computer Use. [Watch Video](https://1drv.ms/v/c/650b027c18d5a573/EehZ7RzY69ZHn-MeQHrnnR4BCj3by-cLLpUVlxMjF4O65Q?e=8LxMgX)
- [2025/1] V2 is coming. We achieve new state of the art results 39.5% on the new grounding benchmark [Screen Spot Pro](https://github.com/likaixin2000/ScreenSpot-Pro-GUI-Grounding/tree/main) with OmniParser v2 (will be released soon)! Read more details [here](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser/tree/master/docs/Evaluation.md).
- [2024/11] We release an updated version, OmniParser V1.5 which features 1) more fine grained/small icon detection, 2) prediction of whether each screen element is interactable or not. Examples in the demo.ipynb. 
- [2024/10] OmniParser was the #1 trending model on huggingface model hub (starting 10/29/2024). 
- [2024/10] Feel free to checkout our demo on [huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/OmniParser)! (stay tuned for OmniParser + Claude Computer Use)
- [2024/10] Both Interactive Region Detection Model and Icon functional description model are released! [Hugginface models](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser)
- [2024/09] OmniParser achieves the best performance on [Windows Agent Arena](https://microsoft.github.io/WindowsAgentArena/)! 

## Install 
First clone the repo, and then install environment:
```python
cd OmniParser
conda create -n "omni" python==3.12
conda activate omni
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have the V2 weights downloaded in weights folder (ensure caption weights folder is called icon_caption_florence). If not download them with:
```
   # download the model checkpoints to local directory OmniParser/weights/
   for f in icon_detect/{train_args.yaml,model.pt,model.yaml} icon_caption/{config.json,generation_config.json,model.safetensors}; do huggingface-cli download microsoft/OmniParser-v2.0 "$f" --local-dir weights; done
   mv weights/icon_caption weights/icon_caption_florence
```

<!-- ## [deprecated]
Then download the model ckpts files in: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser, and put them under weights/, default folder structure is: weights/icon_detect, weights/icon_caption_florence, weights/icon_caption_blip2. 

For v1: 
convert the safetensor to .pt file. 
```python
python weights/convert_safetensor_to_pt.py

For v1.5: 
download 'model_v1_5.pt' from https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser/tree/main/icon_detect_v1_5, make a new dir: weights/icon_detect_v1_5, and put it inside the folder. No weight conversion is needed. 
``` -->

## Examples:
We put together a few simple examples in the demo.ipynb. 

## Gradio Demo
To run gradio demo, simply run:
```python
python gradio_demo.py
```

## Model Weights License
For the model checkpoints on huggingface model hub, please note that icon_detect model is under AGPL license since it is a license inherited from the original yolo model. And icon_caption_blip2 & icon_caption_florence is under MIT license. Please refer to the LICENSE file in the folder of each model: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser.
