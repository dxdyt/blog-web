## Features

- Real-time updates on trending news

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "newsnow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "newsnow-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "BASE_URL": "https://newsnow.busiyi.world"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
You can change the `BASE_URL` to your own domain.

## Deployment

### Basic Deployment

For deployments without login and caching:

1. Fork this repository
2. Import to platforms like Cloudflare Page or Vercel

### Cloudflare Page Configuration

- Build command: `pnpm run build`
- Output directory: `dist/output/public`

### GitHub OAuth Setup

1. [Create a GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. No special permissions required
3. Set callback URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/github` (replace `your-domain` with your actual domain)
4. Obtain Client ID and Client Secret

### Environment Variables

Refer to `example.env.server`. For local development, rename it to `.env.server` and configure:

```env
# Github Client ID
G_CLIENT_ID=
# Github Client Secret
G_CLIENT_SECRET=
# JWT Secret, usually the same as Client Secret
JWT_SECRET=
# Initialize database, must be set to true on first run, can be turned off afterward
INIT_TABLE=true
# Whether to enable cache
ENABLE_CACHE=true
```

### Database Support

Supported database connectors: https://db0.unjs.io/connectors
**Cloudflare D1 Database** is recommended.

1. Create D1 database in Cloudflare Worker dashboard
2. Configure database_id and database_name in wrangler.toml
3. If wrangler.toml doesn't exist, rename example.wrangler.toml and modify configurations
4. Changes will take effect on next deployment

### Docker Deployment

In project root directory:

```sh
docker compose up
```

You can also set Environment Variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Development

> [!Note]
> Requires Node.js >= 20

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

### Adding Data Sources

Refer to `shared/sources` and `server/sources` directories. The project provides complete type definitions and a clean architecture.
