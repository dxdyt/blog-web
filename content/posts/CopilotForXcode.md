[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is an AI pair programmer
tool that helps you write code faster and smarter. Copilot for Xcode is an Xcode
extension that provides inline coding suggestions as you type.

## Beta Preview Policy

Use of the GitHub Copilot Xcode Extension is subject to [GitHub's Pre-Release Terms](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-pre-release-license-terms). We want to remind you that:

> Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.


## Requirements

- macOS 12+
- Xcode 8+
- A GitHub Copilot subscription. To learn more, visit [https://github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).

## Getting Started

1. Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

   ```sh
   brew install --cask github-copilot-for-xcode
   ```

   Or download the `dmg` from
   [the latest release](https://github.com/github/CopilotForXcode/releases/latest/download/GitHubCopilotForXcode.dmg).
   Drag `GitHub Copilot for Xcode` into the `Applications` folder:

   </p>

   Updates can be downloaded and installed by the app.

1. A background item will be added to enable Copilot to start when Xcode is opened.
   <p align="center">

   </p>

1. Two permissions are required: `Accessibility` and `Xcode Source Editor
   Extension`. For more on why these permissions are required see
   [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

   The first time the application is run the `Accessibility` permission should be requested:

   <p align="center">
     <img alt="Screenshot of accessibility permission request" src="./Docs/accessibility-permission-request.png" width="529" />
   </p>

   The `Xcode Source Editor Extension` permission needs to be enabled manually. Click
   `Extension Permission` from the `Copilot for Xcode` settings to open the
   System Preferences to the `Extensions` panel. Select `Xcode Source Editor`
   and enable `GitHub Copilot`:

     <img alt="Screenshot of extension permission" src="./Docs/extension-permission.png" width="582" />
   </p>

1. After granting the extension permission, please restart Xcode to ensure the
   `Github Copilot` menu is available and not disabled under the Xcode `Editor`
   menu.

    </p>

    Keyboard shortcuts can be set for all menu items in the `Key Bindings`
    section of Xcode preferences.

1. To sign into GitHub Copilot, click the `Sign in` button in the settings application. This will open a browser window and copy a code to the clipboard. Paste the code into the GitHub login page and authorize the application.

    </p>

1. To install updates, click `Check for Updates` from the menu item or in the
   settings application.

   After installing a new version, Xcode must be restarted to use the new
   version correctly.

   New versions can also be installed from `dmg` files downloaded from the
   releases page. When installing a new version via `dmg`, the application must
   be run manually the first time to accept the downloaded from the internet
   warning.

1. To avoid confusion, we recommend disabling `Predictive code completion` under
   `Xcode` > `Preferences` > `Text Editing` > `Editing`.

1. Press `tab` to accept the first line of a suggestion, hold `option` to view
   the full suggestion, and press `option` + `tab` to accept the full suggestion.
