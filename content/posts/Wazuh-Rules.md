<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About This Repo

The objective for this repo is to provide the Wazuh community with rulesets that are more accurate, descriptive, and enriched from various sources and integrations.

Here's why:
* Detection rules can be a tricky business and we believe everyone should have access to a strong and growing ruleset.
* Wazuh serves as a great EDR agent, however the default rulesets are rather laxed (in our opinion). We wanted to start building a strong repo of Wazuh rules for the community to implement themselves and expand upon as new threats arise.
* Cybersecurity is hard enough, let's work together :smile:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Feel free to implement all of the rules that are contained within this repo, or pick and choose as you see fit. See our Installation section below for a bash script that can be ran on your Wazuh Manager to quickly put these rules to work!

### Prerequisites

Wazuh-Manager Version 4.x Required.

[Wazuh Install Docs](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/index.html)

[Need Assitance? - Hire SOCFortress](https://www.socfortress.co/contact_form.html)

### Installation

_You can either manually download the .xml rule files onto your Wazuh Manager or make use of our wazuh_socfortress_rules.sh script_

> :warning: **USE AT OWN RISK**: If you already have custom rules built out, there is a good chance duplicate Rule IDs will exists. This will casue the Wazuh-Manager service to fail! Ensure there are no conflicting Rule IDs and your custom rules are backed up prior to running the wazuh_socfortress_rules.sh script!


1. Become Root User
2. Run the Script
   ```sh
   curl -so ~/wazuh_socfortress_rules.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/socfortress/Wazuh-Rules/main/wazuh_socfortress_rules.sh && bash ~/wazuh_socfortress_rules.sh
   ```
