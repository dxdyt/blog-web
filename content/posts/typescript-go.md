# [microsoft/typescript-go](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go)

# TypeScript 7

[Not sure what this is? Read the announcement post!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/)

## Preview

A preview build is available on npm as `@typescript/native-preview`.

```sh
npm install @typescript/native-preview
npx tsgo # Use this as you would tsc.
```

A preview VS Code extension is [available on the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TypeScriptTeam.native-preview).

To use this, set this in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    "typescript.experimental.useTsgo": true
}
```

## How to Build and Run

This repo uses [Go 1.24 or higher](https://go.dev/dl/), [Rust 1.85 or higher](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/), and [`hereby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hereby).

For tests and code generation, this repo contains a git submodule to the main TypeScript repo pointing to the commit being ported.
When cloning, you'll want to clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go.git
```

If you have already cloned the repo, you can initialize the submodule with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

With the submodule in place and `npm ci`, you can run tasks via `hereby`, similar to the TypeScript repo:

```sh
hereby build          # Verify that the project builds
hereby test           # Run all tests
hereby install-tools  # Install additional tools such as linters
hereby lint           # Run all linters
hereby format         # Format all code
hereby generate       # Generate all Go code (e.g. diagnostics, committed to repo)
```

Additional tasks are a work in progress.

`hereby` is not required to work on the repo; the regular `go` tooling (e.g., `go build`, `go test ./...`) will work as expected.
`hereby` tasks are provided as a convenience for those familiar with the TypeScript repo.

### Running `tsgo`

After running `hereby build`, you can run `built/local/tsgo`, which behaves mostly the same as `tsc`.

### Running LSP Prototype

To debug and run the VS Code extension without installing it globally:

* Run VS Code in the repo workspace (`code .`)
* Copy `.vscode/launch.template.json` to `.vscode/launch.json`
* <kbd>F5</kbd> (or `Debug: Start Debugging` from the command palette)

This will launch a new VS Code instance which uses the Corsa LS as the backend. If correctly set up, you should see "tsgo" in the status bar when a TypeScript or JavaScript file is open:

## What Works So Far?

This is still a work in progress and is not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript. Bugs may exist. Please check this list carefully before logging a new issue or assuming an intentional change.

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Program creation | done | Same files and module resolution as TS5.8. Not all resolution modes supported yet. |
| Parsing/scanning | done | Exact same syntax errors as TS5.8 |
| Commandline and `tsconfig.json` parsing | mostly done | Entry point slightly different for now |
| Type resolution | done | Same types as TS5.8 |
| Type checking | done | Same errors, locations, and messages as TS5.8. Types printback in errors may display differently (in progress) |
| JavaScript-specific inference and JS Doc | not ready | - |
| JSX | done | - |
| Declaration emit | not ready | Coming soon |
| Emit (JS output) | in progress | `target: esnext` well-supported, other targets may have gaps |
| Watch mode | prototype | Watches files and rebuilds, but no incremental rechecking |
| Build mode / project references | not ready | - |
| Incremental build | not ready | - |
| Language service (LSP) | prototype | Minimal functionality (errors, hover, go to def). More features coming soon |
| API | not ready | - |

Definitions:

 * **done** aka "believed done": We're not currently aware of any deficits or major left work to do. OK to log bugs
 * **in progress**: currently being worked on; some features may work and some might not. OK to log panics, but nothing else please
 * **prototype**: proof-of-concept only; do not log bugs
 * **not ready**: either haven't even started yet, or far enough from ready that you shouldn't bother messing with it yet

## Other Notes

Long-term, we expect that this repo and its contents will be merged into `microsoft/TypeScript`.
As a result, the repo and issue tracker for typescript-go will eventually be closed, so treat discussions/issues accordingly.

For a list of intentional changes with respect to TypeScript 5.7, see CHANGES.md.
