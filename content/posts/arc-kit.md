## Quick Start

### Installation

**Claude Code** (premier experience) — install the ArcKit plugin (requires **v2.1.112+**):

```text
/plugin marketplace add tractorjuice/arc-kit
```

Then install from the Discover tab. Claude Code is the **primary development platform** for ArcKit and provides the most complete experience: all 68 commands, 10 autonomous research agents, 5 automation hooks (session init, project context injection, filename enforcement, output validation, impact scan), bundled MCP servers (AWS Knowledge, Microsoft Learn, Google Developer Knowledge, govreposcrape), and automatic updates via the marketplace. See [Why Claude Code?](#why-claude-code) below.

> **Why v2.1.112?** This version unlocks the `xhigh` effort tier on Claude Opus 4.7 (used by ArcKit's deep-research agents and synthesis commands), enables Auto mode without `--enable-auto-mode`, restores Opus 4.7 availability for Auto mode, and ships read-only bash glob patterns without permission prompts (reduces friction for ArcKit helper scripts). It also carries forward the v2.1.97 fixes: `claude plugin update` correctly detects new commits for git-based plugins (critical for ArcKit distribution), MCP HTTP/SSE memory leak fix (~50 MB/hr, affects ArcKit's 5 bundled servers), proper 429 exponential backoff (benefits 10 research agents), Stop/SubagentStop hooks no longer fail on long sessions (affects session-learner), and subagent working directory leak fix.

**Gemini CLI** — install the ArcKit extension:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini
```

Zero-config: all 68 commands, templates, scripts, and bundled MCP servers (AWS Knowledge, Microsoft Learn). Updates via `gemini extensions update arckit`.

**GitHub Copilot** (VS Code) — install the ArcKit CLI and scaffold prompt files:

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install git+https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git

# Scaffold a project with Copilot prompt files
arckit init my-project --ai copilot
```

Creates `.github/prompts/arckit-*.prompt.md` (68 prompt files), `.github/agents/arckit-*.agent.md` (10 custom agents), and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (repo-wide context). Invoke commands in Copilot Chat as `/arckit-requirements`, `/arckit-stakeholders`, etc.

**Codex CLI** — install the ArcKit CLI:

```bash
# Install with pip
pip install git+https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git

# Or with uv
uv tool install arckit-cli --from git+https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git

# Or run without installing
uvx --from git+https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git arckit init my-project
```

**Latest Release**: [v4.6.12](https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit/releases/tag/v4.6.12)

### Platform Support

| Platform | Claude Code Plugin | Gemini CLI Extension | GitHub Copilot | Codex / OpenCode CLI |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| macOS | Full support | Full support | Full support | Full support |
| Linux | Full support | Full support | Full support | Full support |
| Windows (WSL2) | Full support | Full support | Full support | Full support |
| Windows (native) | Full support | Full support | Full support | Partial |

**Windows users**: The Claude Code plugin, Gemini CLI extension, and GitHub Copilot prompt files work natively on all platforms. For Codex CLI / OpenCode CLI on native Windows (without WSL), some commands containing inline bash snippets may require [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) or [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). We recommend WSL2 for the best experience.

### Initialize a Project

**Claude Code**: No initialization needed — the plugin provides everything.

**GitHub Copilot** (VS Code):

```bash
# Create a new architecture governance project
arckit init payment-modernization --ai copilot

# Or initialize in current directory
arckit init . --ai copilot
```

**OpenCode CLI**:

```bash
# Create a new architecture governance project
arckit init payment-modernization --ai opencode

# Or initialize in current directory
arckit init . --ai opencode
```

**Codex CLI**:

```bash
# Create a new architecture governance project
arckit init payment-modernization --ai codex

# Minimal install (skip docs and guides)
arckit init payment-modernization --ai codex --minimal

# Or initialize in current directory
arckit init . --ai codex
```

### Start Using ArcKit

```bash
# GitHub Copilot (VS Code)
cd payment-modernization && code .
# In Copilot Chat, use ArcKit commands:
/arckit-principles Create principles for a financial services company
/arckit-requirements Build a payment processing system...

# Codex CLI
cd payment-modernization
codex
# Inside your AI assistant, use ArcKit commands:
/arckit.principles Create principles for a financial services company
/arckit.requirements Build a payment processing system...
/arckit.sow Generate RFP for vendor selection
```

### Upgrading

**Claude Code plugin**: Updates are automatic via the marketplace — no action needed.

**Gemini CLI extension**: Updates via `gemini extensions update arckit`.

**GitHub Copilot**: Re-run `arckit init --here --ai copilot` to update prompt files, agents, and instructions.

**Codex CLI**:

```bash
# Step 1: Upgrade the CLI tool
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git
# Or with uv:
uv tool upgrade arckit-cli --from git+https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git

# Step 2: Update your existing project (re-run init in place)
cd /path/to/your-existing-project
arckit init --here --ai codex
```

This updates commands, templates, scripts, and agents while **preserving** your project data (`projects/`) and custom templates (`.arckit/templates-custom/`).

If upgrading from v0.x, you may also need to migrate legacy filenames — see the [upgrading guide](docs/guides/upgrading.md) for full details.

## Why ArcKit?

### Problem: Architecture Governance is Broken

Traditional enterprise architecture suffers from:

- ❌ Scattered documents across tools (Word, Confluence, PowerPoint)
- ❌ Inconsistent governance enforcement
- ❌ Manual vendor evaluation with bias
- ❌ Lost traceability between requirements and design
- ❌ Stale documentation that doesn't match reality

### Solution: Structured, AI-Assisted Governance

ArcKit provides:

- ✅ **Template-Driven Quality**: Comprehensive templates ensure nothing is forgotten
- ✅ **Systematic Workflows**: Clear processes from requirements → procurement → design review
- ✅ **AI Assistance**: Let AI handle document generation, you focus on decisions
- ✅ **Enforced Traceability**: Automatic gap detection and coverage analysis
- ✅ **Version Control**: Git-based workflow for all architecture artifacts

## The ArcKit Workflow

ArcKit guides you through the enterprise architecture lifecycle:

### Phase 0: Project Planning

**`/arckit.plan`** → Create project plan with timeline, phases, and gates

Visualize your entire project delivery:

- GDS Agile Delivery phases (Discovery → Alpha → Beta → Live)
- Mermaid Gantt chart with timeline, dependencies, and milestones
- Workflow diagram showing gates and decision points
- Tailored timeline based on project complexity
- Integration of all ArcKit commands into schedule
- Gate approval criteria for governance

### Phase 1: Establish Governance

**`/arckit.principles`** → Create enterprise architecture principles

Define your organisation's architecture standards:

- Cloud strategy (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Security frameworks (Zero Trust, compliance)
- Technology standards
- FinOps and cost governance

### Phase 2: Stakeholder Analysis

**`/arckit.stakeholders`** → Analyze stakeholder drivers, goals, and outcomes

**Do this BEFORE business case** to understand who cares about the project and why:

- Identify all stakeholders (internal and external)
- Document underlying drivers (strategic, operational, financial, compliance, risk, personal)
- Map drivers to SMART goals
- Map goals to measurable outcomes
- Create Stakeholder → Driver → Goal → Outcome traceability
- Identify conflicts and synergies
- Define engagement and communication strategies

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment

**`/arckit.risk`** → Create comprehensive risk register (Orange Book)

**Do this BEFORE business case** to identify and assess risks systematically:

- Follow HM Treasury Orange Book 2023 framework
- Identify risks across 6 categories (Strategic, Operational, Financial, Compliance, Reputational, Technology)
- Assess inherent risk (before controls) and residual risk (after controls)
- Apply 4Ts response framework (Tolerate, Treat, Transfer, Terminate)
- Link every risk to stakeholder from RACI matrix
- Monitor risk appetite compliance
- Feed into SOBC Management Case Part E

### Phase 4: Business Case Justification

- Eligibility scoring matrix against project requirements and stakeholder profile
- Application timeline, deadlines, and award values
- Strategic fit assessment (alignment with project goals and public sector context)
- Outputs a structured GRNT funding opportunity register

### Phase 7: Strategic Planning with Wardley Mapping

**`/arckit.wardley`** → Create strategic Wardley Maps

Visualize strategic positioning with:

- Component evolution analysis (Genesis → Custom → Product → Commodity)
- Build vs Buy decision framework
- Vendor comparison and procurement strategy
- UK Government Digital Marketplace mapping

- **Traceability**: Links roadmap themes to stakeholder drivers, architecture principles, requirements
- **UK Government specifics**: Spending Review alignment, TCoP compliance timeline, NCSC CAF progression

**Use this when**: You have a multi-year transformation program with multiple initiatives running in parallel. Roadmaps are strategic (multi-year, multi-initiative, executive communication) vs project plans which are tactical (single initiative, detailed tasks, team execution).

**Roadmap feeds into**: `/arckit.plan` for detailed phase execution, `/arckit.sobc` for investment business case, `/arckit.backlog` for prioritized user stories, `/arckit.strategy` for executive-level synthesis.

### Phase 7.6: Architecture Strategy Synthesis

**`/arckit.strategy`** → Synthesise strategic artifacts into executive-level Architecture Strategy

Create a comprehensive Architecture Strategy document that synthesises multiple strategic artifacts into a single coherent narrative:

- **Strategic vision**: 2-3 paragraphs articulating the transformation vision and success definition
- **Strategic drivers**: Summarised from stakeholder analysis with external drivers (regulatory, market, technology)
- **Guiding principles**: Key principles with strategic implications, compliance summary
- **Current state assessment**: Technology landscape, capability maturity baseline (L1-L5), technical debt, SWOT
- **Target state vision**: Future architecture, capability maturity targets, architecture vision diagram
- **Technology evolution**: Build vs buy decisions, technology radar (Adopt/Trial/Assess/Hold) from Wardley maps
- **Strategic themes**: 3-5 investment themes with objectives, initiatives, success criteria, principles alignment
- **Delivery roadmap summary**: Timeline, phases, milestones from roadmap artifact
- **Investment summary**: CAPEX/OPEX, NPV, IRR, payback period, benefits realisation from SOBC
- **Strategic risks**: Top risks with heat map, assumptions, constraints from risk register
- **Success metrics**: KPIs with baselines and year-over-year targets
- **Governance model**: Forums, decision rights, review cadence
- **Traceability**: Driver → Goal → Outcome → Theme → Principle → KPI chain

**Use this when**: You have multiple strategic artifacts (principles, stakeholders, wardley, roadmap, sobc) and need to create a single executive-level document that synthesises them into a coherent strategy. Ideal for Strategy Board presentations, executive briefings, or stakeholder communication.

**Unique requirement**: This is the only ArcKit command with TWO mandatory inputs (principles AND stakeholders). Strategy cannot be created without understanding both the decision framework and the stakeholder drivers.

**Strategy feeds into**: `/arckit.requirements` for detailed requirements, `/arckit.roadmap` for expanded timeline, `/arckit.plan` for project delivery.

### Phase 7.7: Architecture Decision Records

**`/arckit.adr`** → Document architectural decisions

Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following MADR v4.0 format enhanced with UK Government requirements:

- **Decision metadata**: Sequential numbering (ADR-001, ADR-002), status (Proposed/Accepted/Superseded), escalation level (Team/Cross-team/Department/Cross-government)
- **Stakeholder RACI**: Deciders (accountable), Consulted (SMEs, two-way), Informed (one-way communication)
- **Context and problem statement**: Why this decision is needed, business/technical/regulatory drivers
- **Decision drivers**: Technical forces (performance, security, scalability), business forces (cost, time), compliance forces (GDS Service Standard, TCoP, NCSC, UK GDPR)
- **Options analysis**: Minimum 2-3 options plus "Do Nothing" baseline, each with pros/cons, cost (CAPEX/OPEX/TCO), GDS Service Standard impact, Wardley evolution stage
- **Y-Statement**: Structured justification - "In the context of X, facing Y, we decided for Z to achieve A, accepting B"
- **Consequences**: Positive (benefits, capabilities), Negative (trade-offs, technical debt), Neutral (training, infrastructure), Risks and mitigations
- **Validation**: How implementation will be verified (design reviews, code reviews, testing, monitoring)
- **Traceability**: Links to requirements, principles, stakeholders, research, Wardley maps, diagrams, risk register
- **UK Government specifics**: Escalation levels (Team → Cross-team → Department → Cross-government), governance forums (ARB, TDA, Programme Board), Service Standard/TCoP compliance documentation

**Use this when**: Making significant architectural decisions that affect system structure, quality attributes, or behavior - technology choices (databases, frameworks, cloud services), integration patterns, security approaches, deployment strategies, data management.

**ADR feeds into**: `/arckit.diagram` (architecture diagrams reflect decisions), `/arckit.hld-review` and `/arckit.dld-review` (reviews verify decisions implemented), `/arckit.traceability` (decisions are key traceability artifacts).

Responsible AI assessment:

- AI ethics principles
- Transparency and explainability
- Fairness and bias mitigation
- Data governance for AI
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Impact assessment

**`/arckit.atrs`** → [Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/algorithmic-transparency-recording-standard-hub)

Generate ATRS record for algorithmic decision-making:

- Algorithm details and logic
- Purpose and use case
- Data sources and data quality
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Impact assessment and mitigation

**For MOD Projects**:

**`/arckit.mod-secure`** → MOD Secure by Design assessment

MOD-specific security compliance:

- JSP 440 (Defence Project & Programme Management)
- Information Assurance Maturity Model (IAMM)
- MOD Security clearances and vetting
- STRAP classification handling
- Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs)
- Supplier attestation requirements

**`/arckit.jsp-936`** → [MOD JSP 936](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jsp-936-dependable-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-defence-part-1-directive) AI Assurance Documentation

For defence projects using AI/ML systems:

- JSP 936 (Dependable Artificial Intelligence in Defence)

- 8 AI Lifecycle Phases (Planning to Quality Assurance)
- Approval pathways (2PUS/Ministerial → Defence-Level → TLB-Level)
- RAISOs and Ethics Manager governance
- Human-AI teaming strategy and continuous monitoring

### Phase 15: Project Story & Reporting

**`/arckit.story`** → Generate comprehensive project story

Create narrative historical record with complete timeline analysis:

- **Timeline Analysis**: 4 visualization types (Gantt chart, linear flowchart, detailed table, phase duration pie chart)
- **Timeline Metrics**: Project duration, velocity, phase analysis, critical path identification
- **Complete Timeline**: All events from git log or file modification dates with days-from-start
- **8 Narrative Chapters**: Foundation → Business Case → Requirements → Research → Procurement → Design → Delivery → Compliance
- **Traceability Demonstration**: End-to-end chains with Mermaid diagrams showing stakeholder → goals → requirements → stories → sprints
- **Governance Achievements**: Showcase compliance (TCoP, Service Standard, NCSC CAF), risk management, decision rationale
- **Strategic Context**: Wardley Map insights, build vs buy decisions, vendor selection rationale
- **Lessons Learned**: Pacing analysis, timeline deviations, recommendations for future projects
- **Comprehensive Appendices**: Artifact register, chronological activity log, DSM, command reference, glossary

**When to use**: At project milestones or completion to create shareable story for stakeholders, leadership, or portfolio reporting. Perfect for demonstrating systematic governance and ArcKit workflow value.

**`/arckit.presentation`** → Generate MARP slide deck from project artifacts

Create presentation slides from existing architecture artifacts:

- **MARP Format**: Markdown-based slides with `---` separators — exports to PDF, PPTX, or HTML
- **Focus Modes**: Executive (board-level), Technical (architecture detail), Stakeholder (benefits-focused), Procurement (RFP briefings)
- **Artifact-Driven**: Reads all available project artifacts and extracts key content into slides
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Gantt charts, C4 diagrams, pie charts, and quadrant charts embedded natively
- **Configurable**: Choose slide count (6-8, 10-12, 15-20) and MARP theme (default, gaia, uncover)
- **Doc type code**: `PRES`

**When to use**: Before governance boards, stakeholder briefings, gate reviews, or quarterly portfolio presentations. Run after creating most project artifacts for the richest slide deck.

### Phase 16: Documentation Publishing

**`/arckit.pages`** → Generate documentation site

Publish all project documentation as an interactive website:

- **Static Site Generation**: Generates `docs/index.html` and `docs/manifest.json` — deployable to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)
- **Mermaid Diagram Rendering**: All architecture diagrams render inline with mermaid.js
- **Project Navigation**: Sidebar with collapsible project tree, document categories, and version badges — documents with multiple versions show an inline dropdown selector
- **GOV.UK Styling**: Professional government design system styling
- **Document Index**: Manifest.json provides programmatic access to all artifacts
- **LLM Discovery**: Generates `docs/llms.txt` ([llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) format) so LLM agents and crawlers can index every artifact, guide, and project. Hand-curated `docs/llms.txt` files (without the ArcKit generation marker) are preserved on re-runs

**When to use**: When you want to share project documentation with stakeholders via a professional web interface, or to create a portfolio view of all architecture artifacts.

## Supported AI Assistants

| Assistant | Support | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) | ✅ Premier | **Primary platform.** Plugin with agents, hooks, MCP servers, and auto-updates |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | ✅ Full | Extension with commands, MCP servers, and auto-updates |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | ✅ Core | VS Code prompt files, custom agents, and repo-wide instructions (`arckit init --ai copilot`) |
| [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://chatgpt.com/features/codex) | ✅ Core | CLI with commands and templates. ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Enterprise ([Setup Guide](.codex/README.md)) |
| [OpenCode CLI](https://opencode.net/cli) | ✅ Core | CLI with commands and templates |

> **Platform Support**: ArcKit is developed and tested on **Linux**. Windows has limited support — hooks (session init, project context, filename validation, MCP auto-allow) require bash and jq which are not available on stock Windows. For the best experience on Windows, use a **devcontainer** or **WSL2**.

### Why Claude Code?

Claude Code is the **primary development platform** for ArcKit and provides capabilities not available in other formats:

| Feature | Claude Code | Gemini CLI | Copilot | Codex / OpenCode |
|---------|:-----------:|:----------:|:-------:|:----------------:|
| 68 slash commands | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Templates & scripts | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Bundled MCP servers (AWS, Azure, GCP, DataCommons, govreposcrape) | ✅ | ✅ (3 servers) | — | Manual setup |
| **Autonomous research agents** (10 agents for research, datascout, cloud research, gov code discovery, grants, framework) | ✅ | — | ✅ (10 agents) | — |
| **SessionStart hook** (auto-detect version + projects) | ✅ | — | — | — |
| **UserPromptSubmit hook** (project context injection on every prompt) | ✅ | — | — | — |
| **PreToolUse hook** (ARC filename auto-correction) | ✅ | — | — | — |
| **PermissionRequest hook** (auto-allow MCP documentation tools) | ✅ | — | — | — |
| **Per-command Stop hooks** (output validation, e.g. Wardley Map math checks) | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Wardley Mapping skill (with Pinecone MCP book corpus) | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Mermaid Syntax Reference skill (23 diagram types + config) | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ |
| Automatic marketplace updates | ✅ | ✅ | Manual reinstall | Manual reinstall |
| Zero-config installation | ✅ | ✅ | `arckit init` required | `arckit init` required |

**Agents** run research-heavy commands (market research, data source discovery, cloud service evaluation) in isolated context windows, keeping the main conversation clean and enabling dozens of WebSearch/WebFetch/MCP calls without context bloat.

**Hooks** provide automated governance: filenames are auto-corrected to ArcKit conventions, project context is injected into every prompt so commands know what artifacts exist, MCP tools are auto-approved, and generated outputs like Wardley Maps are validated for mathematical consistency before being finalized.

Gemini CLI provides a strong experience with all commands and MCP servers but lacks agent delegation and hooks. GitHub Copilot provides all 68 commands as prompt files and 10 custom agents but lacks hooks and MCP servers. Codex CLI and OpenCode CLI provide core command functionality but require manual setup and `arckit init` scaffolding.

### Why Commands, Not Skills

Claude Code automatically exposes ArcKit commands as **skills** (they appear in the skills list and can be matched by natural language). ArcKit intentionally uses **slash commands** rather than standalone skills because:

- **Deliberate invocation required** — Every command generates a heavyweight governance document (requirements spec, risk register, DPIA, etc.). Auto-triggering from conversational intent would waste significant time and tokens.
- **Dependency ordering** — Commands follow a deliberate sequence (principles → stakeholders → requirements → data-model → etc.). Skills that auto-trigger could run out of order.
- **User input via `$ARGUMENTS`** — Most commands accept context from the user (project name, scope, constraints). The command system handles this with `$ARGUMENTS` substitution.
- **Best of both worlds** — Since Claude Code exposes commands as skills automatically, users get explicit `/arckit.requirements` invocation AND natural language matching when Claude recognises intent — no restructuring needed.

### Using with GitHub Copilot

For GitHub Copilot users in VS Code, ArcKit commands are delivered as prompt files and custom agents:

```bash
# Install and create project (3 steps, zero config)
pip install git+https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git
arckit init my-project --ai copilot
cd my-project && code .

# Then use ArcKit commands in Copilot Chat
/arckit-principles Create principles for financial services
/arckit-stakeholders Analyze stakeholders for cloud migration
/arckit-requirements Create comprehensive requirements
```

This creates `.github/prompts/arckit-*.prompt.md` (67 prompt files), `.github/agents/arckit-*.agent.md` (9 custom agents), and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (repo-wide context).

### Using with Codex CLI

For OpenAI Codex CLI users, ArcKit commands are delivered as skills and auto-discovered:

```bash
# Install and create project (3 steps, zero config)
pip install git+https://github.com/tractorjuice/arc-kit.git
arckit init my-project --ai codex
cd my-project && codex

# Then use ArcKit skills
$arckit-principles Create principles for financial services
$arckit-stakeholders Analyze stakeholders for cloud migration
$arckit-requirements Create comprehensive requirements
```

See [.codex/README.md](.codex/README.md) for full Codex CLI setup and usage.

## Template Customization

Customize ArcKit templates without modifying defaults:

```bash
# Inside your AI assistant
/arckit.customize requirements   # Copy requirements template for editing
/arckit.customize all            # Copy all templates
/arckit.customize list           # See available templates
```

**How it works:**

- Default templates live in `.arckit/templates/` (refreshed by `arckit init`)
- Your customizations go in `.arckit/templates-custom/` (preserved across updates)
- Commands automatically check for custom templates first, falling back to defaults

**Common customizations:**

- Add organization-specific document control fields
- Include mandatory compliance sections (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS)
- Add department-specific approval workflows
- Customize UK Government classification banners

## Wardley Mapping for Strategic Architecture

ArcKit uses Wardley Maps to expose the strategic position of every component before you commit to a solution. The `/arckit.wardley` command produces ready-to-visualise maps that:

- Trace user needs through the supporting value chain so gaps and duplicated effort are obvious.
- Plot evolution from Genesis → Commodity to reveal when to build, buy, reuse, or retire capabilities.
- Feed procurement, vendor evaluation, and design reviews with shared situational awareness.

Maps are emitted in the Open Wardley Map format — paste them straight into [https://create.wardleymaps.ai](https://create.wardleymaps.ai) for a visual view. Full example outputs live in the public demos such as `arckit-test-project-v3-windows11` (enterprise OS rollout strategy) and `arckit-test-project-v14-scottish-courts` (GenAI platform strategy).

---

## Architecture Diagrams with Mermaid

**ArcKit generates visual architecture diagrams using Mermaid for clear technical communication.**

### What are Architecture Diagrams?

Architecture diagrams visualize system structure, interactions, and deployment for:

- **Technical Communication**: Share architecture with stakeholders
- **Design Documentation**: Document current and future state
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Compare vendor technical approaches
- **UK Government Compliance**: Visualize Cloud First, GOV.UK services, PII handling

### Diagram Types

ArcKit supports 6 essential diagram types based on the C4 Model and enterprise architecture best practices:

| Diagram Type | Level | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **C4 Context** | Level 1 | System in context with users and external systems | After requirements, to show system boundaries |
| **C4 Container** | Level 2 | Technical containers and technology choices | After HLD, for vendor review |
| **C4 Component** | Level 3 | Internal components within a container | After DLD, for implementation |
| **Deployment** | Infrastructure | Cloud resources and network topology | Cloud First compliance, cost estimation |
| **Sequence** | Interaction | API flows and request/response patterns | Integration requirements, API design |
| **Data Flow** | Data | How data moves, PII handling, GDPR compliance | UK GDPR, DPIA requirements |

Use `/arckit.diagram` directly, or supply an explicit type such as `context`, `container`, `sequence`, or `dataflow`. Outputs bundle component inventories with Wardley evolution tags, built-in GOV.UK compliance scaffolding (Notify, Pay, Design System), Cloud First network patterns, GDPR annotations, and traceability back to requirements and tests. For full examples, browse the diagram folders in `arckit-test-project-v3-windows11` and `arckit-test-project-v14-scottish-courts`.

## ServiceNow Service Management Design

ArcKit turns architecture artefacts into an operations-ready ServiceNow pack. The `/arckit.servicenow` command builds:

- CMDB hierarchies, SLAs, and change risk straight from requirements, diagrams, and Wardley Maps.
- ITIL-aligned runbooks covering incident, change, monitoring, and transition activities.
- UK government extras such as GDS Service Standard, Technology Code of Practice, and GOV.UK Pay/Notify dependencies when relevant.

For full outputs, explore the public demos (for example `arckit-test-project-v3-windows11`) where the generated ServiceNow design files and checklists are published end-to-end.

## Relationship to Spec Kit

ArcKit is inspired by [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) but targets a different audience:

| | Spec Kit | ArcKit |
|---|----------|--------|
| **Audience** | Product Managers, Developers | Enterprise Architects, Procurement |
| **Focus** | Feature development (0→1 code generation) | Architecture governance & vendor management |
| **Workflow** | Spec → Plan → Tasks → Code | Requirements → RFP → Design Review → Traceability |
| **Output** | Working code | Architecture documentation & governance |

## Tips

### Continuous Governance Monitoring

Use the `/loop` command to run health checks on a recurring interval during long architecture sessions:

```bash
/loop 30m /arckit.health SEVERITY=HIGH
```

This runs `/arckit.health` every 30 minutes, surfacing stale research, forgotten ADRs, and unresolved review conditions as they appear.

## Troubleshooting

### Token Limit Error

If you see: `API Error: Claude's response exceeded the 32000 output token maximum`

**The Problem**: ArcKit generates large documents that can exceed Claude's 32K token output limit.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Your Claude subscription plan determines the maximum tokens:

- 🔴 Free/Pro plans: **32K max** (cannot be increased)
- ✅ Team/Enterprise plans: Can increase to 64K via environment variable

**Solutions**:

1. **For Team/Enterprise plans** - Increase token limit:

   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000
   ```

2. **For ALL plans** (including Free/Pro) - Use **Write tool strategy**:

   ```text
   User: /arckit.requirements but write directly to file using Write tool, show me only a summary
   ```

   This tells Claude to use the Write tool to create the file (doesn't count toward output tokens) and only show you a summary.

**Which commands are affected?**

- 🔴 HIGH RISK: `/arckit.sobc`, `/arckit.requirements`, `/arckit.data-model`, `/arckit.sow`
- 🟢 MITIGATED (agent): `/arckit.research`, `/arckit.datascout`, `/arckit.aws-research`, `/arckit.azure-research`, `/arckit.gcp-research`, `/arckit.gov-reuse`, `/arckit.gov-code-search`, `/arckit.gov-landscape`, `/arckit.grants` — run as autonomous agents in separate context windows
- 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: `/arckit.risk`, `/arckit.evaluate`, `/arckit.principles`

**See full guide**: [docs/TOKEN-LIMITS.md](docs/TOKEN-LIMITS.md)

### Common Issues

**Command not found**: Ensure commands are available

```bash
# For Codex, check if skills directory exists
ls .agents/skills/arckit-principles/SKILL.md

# For Claude Code, install the ArcKit plugin:
# /plugin marketplace add tractorjuice/arc-kit

# For Gemini CLI, install the ArcKit extension:
# gemini extensions install https://github.com/tractorjuice/arckit-gemini

# For GitHub Copilot, check if prompt files exist
ls .github/prompts/arckit-*.prompt.md

# For OpenCode CLI, check if commands directory exists
ls .opencode/commands/
```

**Template not found**: Ensure you've run `/arckit.principles` first

```bash
# Check if templates exist
ls templates/
```

**Project creation fails**: Ensure you have an ArcKit repository initialized

```bash
# Initialize if needed
arckit init .
```
