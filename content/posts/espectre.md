## In 3 Points

1. **What it does**: Detects movement using Wi-Fi (no cameras, no microphones)
2. **What you need**: A ~€10 ESP32 device (S3 and C6 recommended, other variants supported)
3. **Setup time**: 10-15 minutes

---

## What You Need

### Hardware

- **2.4GHz Wi-Fi Router** - the one you already have at home works fine
- **ESP32 with CSI support** - ESP32-C6, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, ESP32 (original) or other variants. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the complete platform comparison table.

## How It Works

When someone moves in a room, they "disturb" the Wi-Fi waves traveling between the router and the sensor. It's like when you move your hand in front of a flashlight and see the shadow change.

The ESP32 device "listens" to these changes and understands if there's movement.

### Advantages

- **No cameras** (total privacy)
- **No wearables needed** (no bracelets or sensors to wear)
- **Works through walls** (Wi-Fi passes through walls)
- **Very cheap** (~€10 total)

Want to understand the technical details? See [ALGORITHMS.md](micro-espectre/ALGORITHMS.md) for CSI explanation and signal processing documentation.

---

## What You Can Do With It

### Practical Examples

- **Home security**: Get an alert if someone enters while you're away
- **Elderly care**: Monitor activity to detect falls or prolonged inactivity
- **Smart automation**: Turn on lights/heating only when someone is present
- **Energy saving**: Automatically turn off devices in empty rooms
- **Child monitoring**: Alert if they leave the room during the night
- **Climate control**: Heat/cool only occupied zones

---

## Where to Place the Sensor

Optimal sensor placement is crucial for reliable movement detection.

### Recommended Distance from Router

**Optimal range: 3-8 meters**

| Distance | Signal | Multipath | Sensitivity | Noise | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| < 2m | Too strong | Minimal | Low | Low | ❌ Too close |
| 3-8m | Strong | Good | High | Low | ✅ **Optimal** |
| > 10-15m | Weak | Variable | Low | High | ❌ Too far |

### Placement Tips

**Do:**
- Position sensor in the area to monitor (not necessarily in direct line with router)
- Height: 1-1.5 meters from ground (desk/table height)
- External antenna: Use IPEX connector for better reception

**Don't:**
- Avoid metal obstacles between router and sensor (refrigerators, metal cabinets)
- Avoid corners or enclosed spaces (reduces multipath diversity)

## System Architecture

### Processing Pipeline

ESPectre uses a focused processing pipeline for motion detection:

```
┌─────────────┐
│  CSI Data   │  Raw Wi-Fi Channel State Information
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Gain Lock  │  AGC/FFT stabilization (~3 seconds)
│             │  Locks hardware gain for stable measurements
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│    Auto     │  Automatic subcarrier selection (once at boot)
│ Calibration │  Selects optimal 12 subcarriers (NBVI)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Adaptive   │  auto: P95 × 1.1 | min: P100
│  Threshold  │  or fixed manual value
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Hampel    │  Turbulence outlier removal
│   Filter    │  (enabled by default)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Low-pass   │  Noise reduction (smoothing)
│   Filter    │  (optional, disabled by default)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Detection   │  MVS or ML score
│ Evaluation  │  every evaluation_interval packets
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Hit Filter  │  motion_on_hits / motion_off_hits
│             │  edge-driven IDLE ↔ MOTION
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Home        │  Edge-driven motion binary +
│ Assistant   │  periodic Movement Score / Threshold
└─────────────┘
```

### Single or Multiple Sensors

```
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│ ESP32   │  │ ESP32   │  │ ESP32   │
│ Room 1  │  │ Room 2  │  │ Room 3  │
└────┬────┘  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘
     │            │            │
     └────────────┴────────────┘
                  │
                  │ ESPHome Native API
                  ▼
         ┌────────────────────┐
         │   Home Assistant   │
         │   (Auto-discovery) │
         └────────────────────┘
```

Each sensor is automatically discovered by Home Assistant with:
- Binary sensor for motion detection, published immediately on state edges
- Movement score sensor, published on the periodic cadence
- Adjustable threshold (number entity)

### Automatic Subcarrier Selection

ESPectre implements **NBVI** (Normalized Band Variance Index) for automatic subcarrier selection, achieving near-optimal performance (F1>96%) with **zero manual configuration**. The algorithm selects 12 non-consecutive subcarriers based on stability metrics and spectral diversity.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT** (MVS mode): Keep the room **quiet and still** for 10 seconds after device boot. The auto-calibration runs during this time and movement will affect detection accuracy. ML mode skips calibration.

For algorithm details, see [ALGORITHMS.md](micro-espectre/ALGORITHMS.md#subcarrier-selection-nbvi).

## FAQ for Beginners

<details>
<summary>Click to expand FAQ</summary>

**Q: Do I need programming knowledge to use it?**  
A: No! ESPectre uses YAML configuration files. Just download the example, flash it, and configure WiFi via the ESPHome app or web interface.

**Q: Does it work with my router?**  
A: Yes, if your router has 2.4GHz Wi-Fi (virtually all modern routers have it).

**Q: How much does it cost in total?**  
A: Hardware: ~€10 for an ESP32 device (S3/C6 recommended, other variants also work). Software: All free and open source. You'll also need Home Assistant running somewhere (Raspberry Pi ~€35-50, or any existing PC/NAS).

**Q: Do I need to modify anything on the router?**  
A: No! The router works normally. The sensor "listens" to Wi-Fi signals without modifying anything.

**Q: Does it work through walls?**  
A: Yes, the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signal penetrates drywall. Reinforced concrete walls reduce sensitivity but detection remains possible at reduced distances.

**Q: How many sensors are needed for a house?**  
A: It depends on size. One sensor can monitor ~50 m². For larger homes, use multiple sensors (1 sensor every 50-70 m² for optimal coverage).

**Q: Can it distinguish between people and pets?**  
A: The system uses a 2-state segmentation model (IDLE/MOTION) that identifies generic movement without distinguishing between people, pets, or other moving objects. For more sophisticated classification (people vs pets, activity recognition, gesture detection), trained AI/ML models would be required (see [Future Evolution](#future-evolution) section).

**Q: Does it work with mesh Wi-Fi networks?**  
A: Yes, it works normally. Make sure the ESP32 connects to the 2.4 GHz band.

**Q: How accurate is the detection?**  
A: Detection accuracy is highly environment-dependent and requires proper tuning. Factors affecting performance include: room layout, wall materials, furniture placement, distance from router (optimal: 3-8m), and interference levels. In optimal conditions with proper tuning, the system provides reliable movement detection. Adjust the `segmentation_threshold` parameter to tune sensitivity for your specific environment.

**Q: What's the power consumption?**  
A: ~500mW typical during continuous operation. The firmware includes support for power optimization, and deep sleep modes can be implemented for battery-powered deployments, though this would require custom modifications to the code.

**Q: If it doesn't work, can I get help?**  
A: Yes, open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/francescopace/espectre/issues) or contact me via email.

## Security and Privacy

<details>
<summary>Privacy, Security & Ethical Considerations (click to expand)</summary>

### Nature of Collected Data

The system collects **anonymous data** related to the physical characteristics of the Wi-Fi radio channel:
- Amplitudes and phases of OFDM subcarriers
- Statistical signal variances
- **NOT collected**: personal identities, communication contents, images, audio

CSI data represents only the properties of the transmission medium and does not contain direct identifying information.

### Privacy Advantages

- **No cameras**: Respect for visual privacy
- **No microphones**: No audio recording
- **No wearables**: Doesn't require wearable devices
- **Aggregated data**: Only statistical metrics, not raw identifying data

### ⚠️ Disclaimer and Ethical Considerations

**WARNING**: Despite the intrinsic anonymity of CSI data, this system can be used for:

- **Non-consensual monitoring**: Detecting presence/movement of people without their explicit consent
- **Behavioral profiling**: With advanced AI models, inferring daily life patterns
- **Domestic privacy violation**: Tracking activities inside private homes

### Usage Responsibility

**The user is solely responsible for using this system and must:**

1. **Obtain explicit consent** from all monitored persons
2. **Respect local regulations** (GDPR in EU, local privacy laws)
3. **Clearly inform** about the presence of the sensing system
4. **Limit use** to legitimate purposes (home security, personal home automation)
5. **Protect data** with encryption and controlled access
6. **DO NOT use** for illegal surveillance, stalking, or violation of others' privacy
