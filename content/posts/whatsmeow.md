whatsmeow is a Go library for the WhatsApp web multidevice API.

## Discussion
Matrix room: [#whatsmeow:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#whatsmeow:maunium.net)

For questions about the WhatsApp protocol (like how to send a specific type of
message), you can also use the [WhatsApp protocol Q&A] section on GitHub
discussions.

## Usage
The [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/go.mau.fi/whatsmeow) includes docs for all methods and event types.
There's also a [simple example](https://pkg.go.dev/go.mau.fi/whatsmeow#example-package) at the top.
