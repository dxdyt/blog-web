## Why Maestro?

Maestro is built on learnings from its predecessors (Appium, Espresso, UIAutomator, XCTest, Selenium, Playwright) and allows you to easily define and test your Flows.

By combining a human-readable YAML syntax with an interpreted execution engine, it lets you write, run, and scale cross-platform end-to-end tests for mobile and web with ease.

- **Cross-platform coverage** – test Android, iOS, and web apps (React Native, Flutter, hybrid) on emulators, simulators, or real devices.  
- **Human-readable YAML flows** – express interactions as commands like `launchApp`, `tapOn`, and `assertVisible`.  
- **Resilience & smart waiting** – built-in flakiness tolerance and automatic waiting handle dynamic UIs without manual `sleep()` calls.  
- **Fast iteration & simple install** – flows are interpreted (no compilation) and installation is a single script.

**Simple Example:**
```
# flow_contacts_android.yaml

appId: com.android.contacts
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "Create new contact"
- tapOn: "First Name"
- inputText: "John"
- tapOn: "Last Name"
- inputText: "Snow"
- tapOn: "Save"
```

## Maestro Studio – Test IDE

**Maestro Studio Desktop** is a lightweight IDE that lets you design and execute tests visually — no terminal needed. 
It is also free, even though Studio is not an open-source project. So you won't find the Maestro Studio code here.

- **Simple setup** – just download the native app for macOS, Windows, or Linux.  
- **Visual flow builder & inspector** – record interactions, inspect elements, and build flows visually.  
- **AI assistance** – use MaestroGPT to generate commands and answer questions while authoring tests.
