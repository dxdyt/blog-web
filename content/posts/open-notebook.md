## About The Project

![New Notebook](docs/assets/asset_list.png)

An open source, privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM. Why give Google more of our data when we can take control of our own research workflows?

In a world dominated by Artificial Intelligence, having the ability to think 🧠 and acquire new knowledge 💡, is a skill that should not be a privilege for a few, nor restricted to a single provider.

**Open Notebook empowers you to:**
- 🔒 **Control your data** - Keep your research private and secure
- 🤖 **Choose your AI models** - Support for 16+ providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, LM Studio, and more
- 📚 **Organize multi-modal content** - PDFs, videos, audio, web pages, and more
- 🎙️ **Generate professional podcasts** - Advanced multi-speaker podcast generation
- 🔍 **Search intelligently** - Full-text and vector search across all your content
- 💬 **Chat with context** - AI conversations powered by your research

## 🆚 Open Notebook vs Google Notebook LM

| Feature | Open Notebook | Google Notebook LM | Advantage |
|---------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Privacy & Control** | Self-hosted, your data | Google cloud only | Complete data sovereignty |
| **AI Provider Choice** | 16+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) | Google models only | Flexibility and cost optimization |
| **Podcast Speakers** | 1-4 speakers with custom profiles | 2 speakers only | Extreme flexibility |
| **Context Control** | 3 granular levels | All-or-nothing | Privacy and performance tuning |
| **Content Transformations** | Custom and built-in | Limited options | Unlimited processing power |
| **API Access** | Full REST API | No API | Complete automation |
| **Deployment** | Docker, cloud, or local | Google hosted only | Deploy anywhere |
| **Citations** | Comprehensive with sources | Basic references | Research integrity |
| **Customization** | Open source, fully customizable | Closed system | Unlimited extensibility |
| **Cost** | Pay only for AI usage | Monthly subscription + usage | Transparent and controllable |

**Why Choose Open Notebook?**
- 🔒 **Privacy First**: Your sensitive research stays completely private
- 💰 **Cost Control**: Choose cheaper AI providers or run locally with Ollama
- 🎙️ **Better Podcasts**: Full script control and multi-speaker flexibility vs limited 2-speaker deep-dive format
- 🔧 **Unlimited Customization**: Modify, extend, and integrate as needed
- 🌐 **No Vendor Lock-in**: Switch providers, deploy anywhere, own your data

## 🚀 Quick Start

Ready to try Open Notebook? Choose your preferred method:

### ⚡ Instant Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a new directory for your Open Notebook installation
mkdir open-notebook
cd open-notebook

# Using Docker - Get started in 2 minutes
docker run -d \
  --name open-notebook \
  -p 8502:8502 -p 5055:5055 \
  -v ./notebook_data:/app/data \
  -v ./surreal_data:/mydata \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key \
  lfnovo/open_notebook:latest-single
```

**What gets created:**
```
open-notebook/
├── notebook_data/     # Your notebooks and research content
└── surreal_data/      # Database files
```

**Access your installation:**
- **🖥️ Main Interface**: http://localhost:8502 (Streamlit UI)
- **🔧 API Access**: http://localhost:5055 (REST API)
- **📚 API Documentation**: http://localhost:5055/docs (Interactive Swagger UI)

> **⚠️ Important**: 
> 1. **Run from a dedicated folder**: Create and run this from inside a new `open-notebook` folder so your data volumes are properly organized
> 2. **Volume persistence**: The volumes (`-v ./notebook_data:/app/data` and `-v ./surreal_data:/mydata`) are essential to persist your data between container restarts. Without them, you'll lose all your notebooks and research when the container stops.

### 🛠️ Full Installation
For development or customization:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook
cd open-notebook
make start-all
```
