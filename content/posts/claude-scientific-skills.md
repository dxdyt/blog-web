## 🎯 Getting Started

Claude Scientific Skills follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard. Simply copy the skill folders into your skills directory and your AI agent will automatically discover and use them.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills.git
```

### Step 2: Copy Skills to Your Skills Directory

Copy the individual skill folders from `scientific-skills/` to one of the supported skill directories below. You can install skills **globally** (available across all projects) or **per-project** (available only in that project).

**Global installation** (recommended — skills available everywhere):

| Tool | Directory |
|------|-----------|
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/skills/` |

**Project-level installation** (skills scoped to a single project):

| Tool | Directory |
|------|-----------|
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` (in your project root) |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` (in your project root) |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/` (in your project root) |

> **Note:** Cursor also reads from `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/` directories, and vice versa, so skills are cross-compatible between tools.

**Example — global install for Cursor:**
```bash
cp -r claude-scientific-skills/scientific-skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/
```

**Example — global install for Claude Code:**
```bash
cp -r claude-scientific-skills/scientific-skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Example — project-level install:**
```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/skills
cp -r /path/to/claude-scientific-skills/scientific-skills/* .cursor/skills/
```

**That's it!** Your AI agent will automatically discover the skills and use them when relevant to your scientific tasks. You can also invoke any skill manually by mentioning the skill name in your prompt.

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this free to use?**  
A: Yes! This repository is MIT licensed. However, each individual skill has its own license specified in the `license` metadata field within its `SKILL.md` file—be sure to review and comply with those terms.

**Q: Why are all skills grouped together instead of separate packages?**  
A: We believe good science in the age of AI is inherently interdisciplinary. Bundling all skills together makes it trivial for you (and your agent) to bridge across fields—e.g., combining genomics, cheminformatics, clinical data, and machine learning in one workflow—without worrying about which individual skills to install or wire together.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**  
A: The repository itself is MIT licensed, which allows commercial use. However, individual skills may have different licenses—check the `license` field in each skill's `SKILL.md` file to ensure compliance with your intended use.

**Q: Do all skills have the same license?**  
A: No. Each skill has its own license specified in the `license` metadata field within its `SKILL.md` file. These licenses may differ from the repository's MIT License. Users are responsible for reviewing and adhering to the license terms of each individual skill they use.

**Q: How often is this updated?**  
A: We regularly update skills to reflect the latest versions of packages and APIs. Major updates are announced in release notes.

**Q: Can I use this with other AI models?**  
A: The skills follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) standard and work with any compatible agent, including Cursor, Claude Code, and Codex.

### Installation & Setup

**Q: Do I need all the Python packages installed?**  
A: No! Only install the packages you need. Each skill specifies its requirements in its `SKILL.md` file.

**Q: What if a skill doesn't work?**  
A: First check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section. If the issue persists, file an issue on GitHub with detailed reproduction steps.

**Q: Do the skills work offline?**  
A: Database skills require internet access to query APIs. Package skills work offline once Python dependencies are installed.

### Contributing

**Q: Can I contribute my own skills?**  
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions. See the [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines and best practices.

**Q: How do I report bugs or suggest features?**  
A: Open an issue on GitHub with a clear description. For bugs, include reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior.
