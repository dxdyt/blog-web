# OpenVMM

[![Build Status](https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm/actions/workflows/openvmm-ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm/actions/workflows/openvmm-ci.yaml)

OpenVMM is a modular, cross-platform Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), written in
Rust.

Although it can function as a traditional VMM, OpenVMM's development is
currently focused on its role in the OpenHCL paravisor.

This repo is the home for both projects.

For more information, read our [guide](https://openvmm.dev/)
or our [introductory blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-os-platform-blog/openhcl-the-new-open-source-paravisor/ba-p/4273172).

## Getting Started
