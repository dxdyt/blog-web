# Claude Desktop for Linux

This project provides build scripts to run Claude Desktop natively on Linux systems. It repackages the official Windows application for Linux distributions, producing `.deb` packages (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` packages (Fedora/RHEL), distribution-agnostic AppImages, an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-desktop-appimage) for Arch Linux, and a Nix flake for NixOS.

**Note:** This is an unofficial build script. For official support, please visit [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com). For issues with the build script or Linux implementation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues) in this repository.

> **⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL: Cowork Mode Support**
> Cowork mode is **enabled by default** in this build with a pluggable isolation backend:
>
> | Backend | Isolation | Requirements |
> |---------|-----------|-------------|
> | **bubblewrap** (default) | Namespace sandbox | `bwrap` installed and functional |
> | **host** (fallback) | None — runs directly on host | No additional requirements |
>
> The best available backend is auto-detected at startup. Run `claude-desktop --doctor` to check which backend will be used and which dependencies are missing.
>
> **Note:** The bubblewrap backend mounts your home directory as read-only (only the project working directory is writable). The host backend provides no isolation — use it only if you understand the security implications.
>
> **KVM status:** The KVM/QEMU backend code exists but is non-functional — VM file downloads are disabled on Linux to prevent a checksum loop (#337). The backend code remains for potential future use.

## Installation

### Using APT Repository (Debian/Ubuntu - Recommended)

Add the repository for automatic updates via `apt`:

```bash
# Add the GPG key
curl -fsSL https://aaddrick.github.io/claude-desktop-debian/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/claude-desktop.gpg

# Add the repository
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/claude-desktop.gpg arch=amd64,arm64] https://aaddrick.github.io/claude-desktop-debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/claude-desktop.list

# Update and install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install claude-desktop
```

Future updates will be installed automatically with your regular system updates (`sudo apt upgrade`).

### Using DNF Repository (Fedora/RHEL - Recommended)

Add the repository for automatic updates via `dnf`:

```bash
# Add the repository
sudo curl -fsSL https://aaddrick.github.io/claude-desktop-debian/rpm/claude-desktop.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/claude-desktop.repo

# Install
sudo dnf install claude-desktop
```

Future updates will be installed automatically with your regular system updates (`sudo dnf upgrade`).

### Using AUR (Arch Linux)

The [`claude-desktop-appimage`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-desktop-appimage) package is available on the AUR and is automatically updated with each release.

```bash
# Using yay
yay -S claude-desktop-appimage

# Or using paru
paru -S claude-desktop-appimage
```

The AUR package installs the AppImage build of Claude Desktop.

### Using Nix Flake (NixOS)

Install directly from the flake:

```bash
# Basic install
nix profile install github:aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian

# With MCP server support (FHS environment)
nix profile install github:aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian#claude-desktop-fhs
```

Or add to your NixOS configuration:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.claude-desktop.url = "github:aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, claude-desktop, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ({ pkgs, ... }: {
          nixpkgs.overlays = [ claude-desktop.overlays.default ];
          environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.claude-desktop ];
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

### Using Pre-built Releases

Download the latest `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.AppImage` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/releases).

### Building from Source

See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) for detailed build instructions.

## Configuration

Model Context Protocol settings are stored in:
```
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

For additional configuration options including environment variables and Wayland support, see [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Troubleshooting

Run `claude-desktop --doctor` for built-in diagnostics that check common issues (display server, sandbox permissions, MCP config, stale locks, and more). It also reports cowork mode readiness — which isolation backend will be used, and which dependencies (KVM, QEMU, vsock, socat, virtiofsd, bubblewrap) are installed or missing.

For additional troubleshooting, uninstallation instructions, and log locations, see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Sponsorship

Anthropic doesn't publish release notes for Claude Desktop. Each release here includes AI-generated notes that analyze code changes between versions. I wrote up how that process works if you're curious: [Generating Real Release Notes from Minified Electron Apps](https://nonconvexlabs.com/blog/generating-real-release-notes-from-minified-electron-apps).

The analysis runs against Claude's API. Costs vary a lot depending on how big the update is. Recent releases have run between **$3.36 and $76.16 per release**.

If this project is useful to you, consider [sponsoring on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/aaddrick) to help cover those costs.
