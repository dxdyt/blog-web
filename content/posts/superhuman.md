# Superhuman Reasoning

This repository hosts projects and datasets created by Google DeepMind's
Superhuman Reasoning team, led by Thang Luong.

## Projects
### AlphaGeometry
Nature [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5).
See https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry.

### AlphaGeometry2
[2024 IMO-silver achievement](https://deepmind.google/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/).
See https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry2.

### [IMO Bench](imobench/README.md)
A suite of advanced benchmarks designed to evaluate robust mathematical
reasoning in AI. Following our
[2025 IMO-gold achievement](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/),
 this release includes:

* *IMO-AnswerBench*: 400 challenging short-answer problems.

* *IMO-ProofBench*: 60 proof-based problems vetted by experts.

* *IMO-GradingBench*: A dataset of 1000 human gradings to advance automatic
evaluation.

## [Aletheia](aletheia/README.md)
A math research agent, powered by Gemini Deep Think, that can iteratively
generate, verify, and revise solutions. See [paper](aletheia/Aletheia.pdf).

This release includes prompts and outputs from Aletheia on research level math
problems.
