# AIBrix

Welcome to AIBrix, an open-source initiative designed to provide essential building blocks to construct scalable GenAI inference infrastructure. AIBrix delivers a cloud-native solution optimized for deploying, managing, and scaling large language model (LLM) inference, tailored specifically to enterprise needs.

## Key Features

The initial release includes the following key features:

- **High-Density LoRA Management**: Streamlined support for lightweight, low-rank adaptations of models.
- **LLM Gateway and Routing**: Efficiently manage and direct traffic across multiple models and replicas.
- **LLM App-Tailored Autoscaler**: Dynamically scale inference resources based on real-time demand.
- **Unified AI Runtime**: A versatile sidecar enabling metric standardization, model downloading, and management.
- **Distributed Inference**: Scalable architecture to handle large workloads across multiple nodes.
- **Distributed KV Cache**: Enables high-capacity, cross-engine KV reuse.
- **Cost-efficient Heterogeneous Serving**: Enables mixed GPU inference to reduce costs with SLO guarantees.
- **GPU Hardware Failure Detection**: Proactive detection of GPU hardware issues.
