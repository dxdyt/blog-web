# Android Reverse Engineering & API Extraction — Claude Code skill

A Claude Code skill that decompiles Android APK/XAPK/JAR/AAR files and **extracts the HTTP APIs** used by the app — Retrofit endpoints, OkHttp calls, hardcoded URLs, authentication patterns — so you can document and reproduce them without the original source code.

## What it does

- **Decompiles** APK, XAPK, JAR, and AAR files using jadx and Fernflower/Vineflower (single engine or side-by-side comparison)
- **Extracts and documents APIs**: Retrofit endpoints, OkHttp calls, hardcoded URLs, auth headers and tokens
- **Traces call flows** from Activities/Fragments through ViewModels and repositories down to HTTP calls
- **Analyzes** app structure: manifest, packages, architecture patterns
- **Handles obfuscated code**: strategies for navigating ProGuard/R8 output

## Requirements

**Required:**
- Java JDK 17+
- [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) (CLI)

**Optional (recommended):**
- [Vineflower](https://github.com/Vineflower/vineflower) or [Fernflower](https://github.com/JetBrains/fernflower) — better output on complex Java code
- [dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar) — needed to use Fernflower on APK/DEX files

See `plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/references/setup-guide.md` for detailed installation instructions.

## Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)

Inside Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add SimoneAvogadro/android-reverse-engineering-skill
/plugin install android-reverse-engineering@android-reverse-engineering-skill
```

The skill will be permanently available in all future sessions.

### From a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimoneAvogadro/android-reverse-engineering-skill.git
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/android-reverse-engineering-skill
/plugin install android-reverse-engineering@android-reverse-engineering-skill
```

## Usage

### Slash command

```
/decompile path/to/app.apk
```

This runs the full workflow: dependency check, decompilation, and initial structure analysis.

### Natural language

The skill activates on phrases like:

- "Decompile this APK"
- "Reverse engineer this Android app"
- "Extract API endpoints from this app"
- "Follow the call flow from LoginActivity"
- "Analyze this AAR library"

### Manual scripts

The scripts can also be used standalone:

```bash
# Check dependencies
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/check-deps.sh

# Install a missing dependency (auto-detects OS and package manager)
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/install-dep.sh jadx
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/install-dep.sh vineflower

# Decompile APK with jadx (default)
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh app.apk

# Decompile XAPK (auto-extracts and decompiles each APK inside)
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh app-bundle.xapk

# Decompile with Fernflower
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh --engine fernflower library.jar

# Run both engines and compare
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/decompile.sh --engine both --deobf app.apk

# Find API calls
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --retrofit
bash plugins/android-reverse-engineering/skills/android-reverse-engineering/scripts/find-api-calls.sh output/sources/ --urls
```
