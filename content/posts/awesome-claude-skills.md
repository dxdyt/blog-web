A comprehensive and curated list of 1000+ production ready and practical Claude Skills and Plugins for enhancing productivity across usecases on not just Claude.ai, Claude Code, but also across coding agents like Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity and more.


> **Want skills that do more than generate text?** Claude can send emails, create issues, post to Slack, and take actions across 1000+ apps. [See how →](./connect/)

---

## Quickstart: Connect Claude to 500+ Apps

The **connect-apps** plugin lets Claude perform real actions - send emails, create issues, post to Slack. It handles auth and connects to 500+ apps using Composio under the hood.

### 1. Install the Plugin

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./connect-apps-plugin
```

### 2. Run Setup

```
/connect-apps:setup
```

Paste your API key when asked. (Get a free key at [dashboard.composio.dev](https://dashboard.composio.dev/login?utm_source=Github&utm_content=AwesomeSkills))

### 3. Restart & Try It

```bash
exit
claude
```

> **Want skills that do more than generate text?** Claude can send emails, create issues, post to Slack, and take actions across 1000+ apps. [See how →](./connect/)

If you receive the email, Claude is now connected to 500+ apps.

## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are reusable instruction packages that teach an AI agent how to handle a specific class of tasks. Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name, description) and Markdown instructions, optionally bundled with scripts, references, and assets. Anthropic introduced the format in October 2025 and released it as an [open standard](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) in December 2025; it's now supported by Claude Code, Claude.ai, the Claude API, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and Windsurf.

Skills load progressively. At session start, the agent sees only each skill's name and description — roughly 100 tokens per skill. The full SKILL.md body (typically under 5,000 tokens) loads only when the agent decides the skill is relevant to the current task. Auxiliary files in `scripts/` and `references/` load on demand. This is what lets a single agent host hundreds of skills without bloating its context window.

Skills are not MCP servers and not tools. MCP defines how an agent connects to external systems — auth, transport, tool discovery. Tools are the individual functions an agent invokes. Skills define the workflow — what to do, in what order, with what guardrails — once the agent has the connections and tools it needs. In production, all three layers run together: MCP for access, tools for actions, skills for behavior.

## Getting Started

### Using Skills in Claude.ai

1. Click the skill icon (🧩) in your chat interface.
2. Add skills from the marketplace or upload custom skills.
3. Claude automatically activates relevant skills based on your task.

### Using Skills in Claude Code

1. Place the skill in `~/.config/claude-code/skills/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
   cp -r skill-name ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
   ```

2. Verify skill metadata:
   ```bash
   head ~/.config/claude-code/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md
   ```

3. Start Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

4. The skill loads automatically and activates when relevant.

### Using Skills via API

Use the Claude Skills API to programmatically load and manage skills:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    skills=["skill-id-here"],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt"}]
)
```

See the [Skills API documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/skills-guide) for details.
