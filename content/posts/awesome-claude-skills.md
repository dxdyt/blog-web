## Quickstart: Connect Claude to 500+ Apps

The **connect-apps** plugin lets Claude perform real actions - send emails, create issues, post to Slack. It handles auth and connects to 500+ apps using Composio under the hood.

### 1. Install the Plugin

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./connect-apps-plugin
```

### 2. Run Setup

```
/connect-apps:setup
```

Paste your API key when asked. (Get a free key at [platform.composio.dev](https://platform.composio.dev/?utm_source=Github&utm_content=AwesomeSkills))

### 3. Restart & Try It

```bash
exit
claude
```

> **Want skills that do more than generate text?** Claude can send emails, create issues, post to Slack, and take actions across 1000+ apps. [See how →](./connect/)

If you receive the email, Claude is now connected to 500+ apps.
