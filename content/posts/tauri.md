## Introduction

Tauri is a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.

The user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS & iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.

To learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Getting Started

If you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).

The quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:

```sh
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

## Features

The list of Tauri's features includes, but is not limited to:

- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).
- Built-in self updater (desktop only)
- System tray icons
- Native notifications
- Native WebView Protocol (tauri doesn't create a localhost http(s) server to serve the WebView contents)
- GitHub action for streamlined CI
- VS Code extension

## Contributing

Before you start working on something, it's best to check if there is an existing issue first. It's also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.

Please make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.

Thank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!

### Documentation

Documentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation in the Rust & JS source code as much as possible. Check out the hosting repository for the documentation site for further information: <https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs>
