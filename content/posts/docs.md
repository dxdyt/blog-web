# La Suite Docs : Collaborative Text Editing
Docs, where your notes can become knowledge through live collaboration.

<img src="/docs/assets/docs_live_collaboration_light.gif" width="100%" align="center"/>

## Why use Docs ❓
Docs is a collaborative text editor designed to address common challenges in knowledge building and sharing.

### Write
* 😌 Get simple, accessible online editing for your team.
* 💅 Create clean documents with beautiful formatting options.
* 🖌️ Focus on your content using either the in-line editor, or [the Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* 🧱 Quickly design your page thanks to the many block types, accessible from the `/` slash commands, as well as keyboard shortcuts.
* 🔌 Write offline! Your edits will be synced once you're back online.
* ✨ Save time thanks to our AI actions, such as rephrasing, summarizing, fixing typos, translating, etc. You can even turn your selected text into a prompt!

### Work together
* 🤝 Enjoy live editing! See your team collaborate in real time.
* 🔒 Keep your information secure thanks to granular access control. Only share with the right people.
* 📑 Export your content in multiple formats (`.odt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`) with customizable templates.
* 📚 Turn your team's collaborative work into organized knowledge with Subpages.

### Self-host

#### 🚀 Docs is easy to install on your own servers
We use Kubernetes for our [production instance](https://docs.numerique.gouv.fr/) but also support Docker Compose. The community contributed a couple other methods (Nix, YunoHost etc.) check out the [docs](/docs/installation/README.md) to get detailed instructions and examples.

#### 🌍 Known instances
We hope to see many more, here is an incomplete list of public Docs instances. Feel free to make a PR to add ones that are not listed below🙏

| Url | Org | Public |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| [docs.numerique.gouv.fr](https://docs.numerique.gouv.fr/)    | DINUM    | French public agents working for the central administration and the extended public sphere. ProConnect is required to login in or sign up|
| [docs.suite.anct.gouv.fr](https://docs.suite.anct.gouv.fr/)    | ANCT    | French public agents working for the territorial administration and the extended public sphere. ProConnect is required to login in or sign up|
| [notes.demo.opendesk.eu](https://notes.demo.opendesk.eu)    | ZenDiS    | Demo instance of OpenDesk. Request access to get credentials |
| [notes.liiib.re](https://notes.liiib.re/)    | lasuite.coop    | Free and open demo to all. Content and accounts are reset after one month |
| [docs.federated.nexus](https://docs.federated.nexus/)    | federated.nexus    | Public instance, but you have to [sign up for a Federated Nexus account](https://federated.nexus/register/). |
| [docs.demo.mosacloud.eu](https://docs.demo.mosacloud.eu/)    | mosa.cloud    | Demo instance of mosa.cloud, a dutch company providing services around La Suite apps. |

#### ⚠️ Advanced features
For some advanced features (ex: Export as PDF) Docs relies on XL packages from BlockNote. These are licenced under GPL and are not MIT compatible. You can perfectly use Docs without these packages by setting the environment variable `PUBLISH_AS_MIT` to true. That way you'll build an image of the application without the features that are not MIT compatible. Read the [environment variables documentation](/docs/env.md) for more information.

## Getting started 🔧

### Test it

You can test Docs on your browser by visiting this [demo document](https://impress-preprod.beta.numerique.gouv.fr/docs/6ee5aac4-4fb9-457d-95bf-bb56c2467713/)

### Run Docs locally

> ⚠️ The methods described below for running Docs locally is **for testing purposes only**. It is based on building Docs using [Minio](https://min.io/) as an S3-compatible storage solution. Of course you can choose any S3-compatible storage solution.

**Prerequisite**

Make sure you have a recent version of Docker and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed on your laptop, then type:

```shellscript
$ docker -v

Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61

$ docker compose version

Docker Compose version v2.32.4
```

> ⚠️ You may need to run the following commands with `sudo`, but this can be avoided by adding your user to the local `docker` group.

**Project bootstrap**

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

```shellscript
$ make bootstrap FLUSH_ARGS='--no-input'
```

This command builds the `app-dev` and `frontend-dev` containers, installs dependencies, performs database migrations and compiles translations. It's a good idea to use this command each time you are pulling code from the project repository to avoid dependency-related or migration-related issues.

Your Docker services should now be up and running 🎉

You can access the project by going to <http://localhost:3000>.

You will be prompted to log in. The default credentials are:

```
username: impress
password: impress
```

📝 Note that if you need to run them afterwards, you can use the eponymous Make rule:

```shellscript
$ make run
```

⚠️ For the frontend developer, it is often better to run the frontend in development mode locally.

To do so, install the frontend dependencies with the following command:

```shellscript
$ make frontend-development-install
```

And run the frontend locally in development mode with the following command:

```shellscript
$ make run-frontend-development
```

To start all the services, except the frontend container, you can use the following command:

```shellscript
$ make run-backend
```

To execute frontend tests & linting only
```shellscript
$ make frontend-test
$ make frontend-lint
```

**Adding content**

You can create a basic demo site by running this command:

```shellscript
$ make demo
```

Finally, you can check all available Make rules using this command:

```shellscript
$ make help
```

**Django admin**

You can access the Django admin site at:

<http://localhost:8071/admin>.

You first need to create a superuser account:

```shellscript
$ make superuser
```
